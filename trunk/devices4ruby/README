OVERVIEW

This is a collection of simple modules that you extend IO objects with, to
give them support for specific devices.  For example:

	require "linux/SoundMixer"
	f = File.open "/dev/mixer"
	f.extend Linux::SoundMixer

	# f now has special accessors for driver variables, e.g:

	f.treble = left_speaker_percent + 256 * right_speaker_percent

The modules are made of automatically generated methods, much like Ruby's
accessors. those generators are called ioctl_reader, ioctl_writer,
ioctl_accessor. Writing expects an integer in -2**31...2**31; reading will
return the same. You may browse the source to find out which accessors are
available, and it's easy to add support for more features.
