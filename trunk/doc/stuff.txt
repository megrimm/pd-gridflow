The following are called VecOps because each operation happens between more than just two numbers.
A first kind of VecOp are those that arise when a pair of numbers (A0,A1) is considered as a single number A0+A1*sqrt(-1).
If you need complex numbers but don't know yet how they work, learn them using a math tutorial and then those VecOps will begin to seem familiar.
All the complex number operators are only for floats.
TODO: fill the last two columns of this table.

Synchronisation

In GridFlow you cannot send two grids in different inlets at the 
same time. You have to use [#finished] together with (possibly) [fork] and [#store], 
which can be cumbersome. If you don't do this, the result is undefined 
behaviour (or crash!).
There are two exceptions: [#store] and # allow right-inlet grids to be buffered if an operation is occuring on left inlet. This 
should make many programs simpler.
