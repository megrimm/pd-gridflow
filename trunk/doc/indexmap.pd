#X text 65 56 an indexmap is a grid as given to the left inlet of (_____).
;
#X text 65 90 an indexmap makes one kind of grid from another kind
of grid (which may be the same kind).;
#X text 65 125 an image-to-image indexmap is itself an image \, with
two channels \, except that its pixels do not represent colours: instead
they represent positions in another image (because indexmaps always
ever represent positions in another grid).;
#X text 270 184 should indexmaps be called something else instead ?
I've used that name for very long \, but "map" might not be the most
precise word.;
#X text 66 232 for a normal image made of rows first (rows \, columns
\, channels) \, the two channels are:;
#X text 97 256 0: row number;
#X text 97 268 1: column number;
