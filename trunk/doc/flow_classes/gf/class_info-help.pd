#X text 232 726 indicates that the class has a method named \$2 in
inlet \$1.;
#X text 232 809 inlet -1 represents methods that exist in all inlets
at once from a single definition. this occurs normally only when there
is a variable number of inlets.;
#X text 232 857 a grid method is listed three times : each grid method
is accompanied by a float method and a list method. If any local float
method or list method is hiding the default method(s) brought by the
grid method \, you will not notice.;
#X text 232 918 "method -2 anything" represents a method that catches
anything in any inlet at once.;
#X text 232 953 there is currently no way to define a anything in a
single inlet at a time.;
#X text 232 988 other methods in inlet -2 are for internal use ONLY.
they are not directly reachable from pd.;
#X text 232 748 the constructor (aka creator or new-method) and the
destructor (free-method) are not listed. the dsp-method and perform-function
(for ~ objects) are not listed. however \, the loadbang method is listed.
;
#X text 232 1023 inlet numbers don't correspond in some rare cases
: when the CLASS_NOINLET option is in use \, GF inlet numbers don't
match Pd inlet numbers \, the left inlet will be numbered 1 instead
of 0 \, and inlet 0 will be invisible. GF currently only uses this
for [#from~] \, but may come to use it for [shunt] \, [route2] \, [route3]
and some more.;

#X obj 97 456 doc_m o0 attr;
#X text 232 456 indicates that \$1 is a valid argument to the get-method
\, and that the get-method will output something named like that when
called without arguments.;
#X text 232 504 some attributes are special in some ways that make
them hidden from that list but still supported by 'get'. this co√Øncides
with when 'get' exceptionally appears in the list of methods.;
#X text 232 1110 methods of superclasses are not listed. those are
rare in GF. this mostly just means that 'get' is not listed \, because
it is common to all classes. ('help' was also a common method like
that \, but it was removed in 9.11). it can happen that 'get' is listed
\, when the 'get' of a class has any special cases in it.;
#X text 232 408 if class or alias is not found in GridFlow's class
database. this only covers the C++/source_filter.rb interface \, and
NOT the abstractions.;
#X text 96 51 has variable number of inlets (and doesn't say it);
#X obj 97 565 doc_m o0 inlets;
#X obj 97 1197 doc_m o0 outlets;
#X text 232 565 number of inlets of objects of that class. if the class
has variable number of inlets \, this is the "initial" number of inlets
\, which normally means the minimum possible number of inlets \, even
though that case may not be the most useful nor the default.;
#X text 232 1197 number of outlets of objects of that class. if the
class has variable number of outlets \, this is the "initial" number
of outlets \, which normally means the minimum possible number of outlets
\, even though that case may not be the most useful nor the default.
;
#X text 232 639 if there CLASS_NOINLET \, GF's inlet 0 will not be
visible in Pd \, therefore this number will be one more than reported.
Furthermore \, signal inlets will never be reported because they are
not supported by GF's C++ interface. Anything created using inlet_new
will not be reported (but this only happens in [#from~] at the moment)
;
#X text 232 1271 signal outlets will never be reported because they
are not supported by GF's C++ interface. Anything created using outlet_new
will not be reported (but this only happens in [#to~] at the moment)
