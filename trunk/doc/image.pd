#X text 96 38 IMAGES;
#X text 24 69 the default format of an image in GridFlow is a grid
that has three dimensions \, in which the first one is for the rows
\, the second one is for the columns \, and the third one is for channels.
Thus they are often numbered like this (starting at 0) :;
#X text 93 146 0 : rows;
#X text 93 159 1 : columns;
#X text 93 173 2 : channels;
#X text 22 197 However \, they don't need to be represented like that
\, so \, you can change the order of dimensions \, but this changes
the order of the data in memory \, and most of all \, it won't work
with any classes that assume the default numbering of the dimensions.
In several cases \, though \, the class doesn't care about the numbering
\, and it is up to the user to know which dimension is which \, and
it is in this context that it is possible to use alternate representations.

#X text 97 483 Because Grids are made of 32-bit integers \, a three-channel
picture uses 96 bpp (bits per pixel) \, and have to be downscaled to
24 bpp (or 16 bpp) for display. That huge amount of slack is there
because when you create your own effects you often have intermediate
results that need to be of higher precision than a normal picture.
Especially \, results of multiplications are big and should not overflow
before you divide them back to normal \; and similarly \, you can have
negative values all over \, as long as you take care of them before
they get to the display. In the final conversion \, high bits are just
ignored. This means: black is 0 \, maximum is 255 \, and values wrap
like with % 256 If you want to clip them \, you may use [# max 0] and
[# min 255] objects.;
