as such. GridFlow objects that accept or produce grids are identified

#X text 5 28 A grid is composed of rows and columns that contain numeric
data. Computers interpret images as three-dimensional grids: the rows
(height and columns (width) contain pixel positions. There are usually
three channels (depth) of rows and columns. Each channel is a single
colour \, usually red \, green and blue (RGB). The channels make up
the colour information of an image. Videos are also interpreted as
grids since each frame is a still image;
