| Hardware and Software you Probably Need

Computer/Processor: GridFlow is mainly made on PC. This includes AMD 
K6/K7/K8 (Athlon/Opteron/etc), Intel P2/P3/P4 and other Pentiums, Intel 
CoreDuo, etc.; the absolute minimum is 386. However, it has also been 
built for Macintosh PowerPC (G3/G4/G5) recently.

Operating System: GridFlow is mainly made on Ubuntu. We have also used 
Debian, SuSE, Mandrake, OSX. Microsoft Windows is not supported, but if 
you do want to try to add support for that, try CygWin and/or MinGW.

Required Software:
	Ruby 1.8 or 1.9
	PureData 0.41 or later, or DesireData
	GNU C++ Compiler (g++) version 3.x or 4.x
	GNU Make
	SVN
	Developer CD (XCODE) (if using OSX)
	FINK (if using OSX)

Multimedia Components (optional):
	libSDL (Simple Directmedia Layer)
	libjpeg
	libpng
	libmpeg3 (.mpg reader, HeroineWarrior's)
	libquicktime (.mov reader/writer, Burkhard Plaum's or 
		HeroineWarrior's)
	libmpeg (.mpg reader, Greg Ward's, old)
	Apple QuickTime (.mov reader/writer and camera interface)
	Ascii Art Library (aalib)
	PCI video digitizer card  (and Video4linux 1 driver)
	USB camera (and Video4linux 1 driver)
	FFTW3
	OpenCV
	NetPBM
	OpenGL (and GLEW)
	GEM (if you have OpenGL)
	Apple X11 (for 10.3: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11formacosx.html
		   for 10.4: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11update2006113.html )

| Downloading from SVN

The SVN has the absolute latest version of GridFlow, but it's not 
guaranteed to be working, whereas the actual releases are more tested. 
However you may have various reasons to use the SVN edition, so here's 
how: Make sure you have the svn program installed.

cd pd/extra
svn checkout http://gridflow.ca/svn/trunk
mv trunk gridflow
And the subsequent times, you only do this:
cd pd/extra/gridflow
svn update

.-o--------------------------------------------------------------
| Installation instructions (incl. compilation)

  Install Ruby.

  Download GridFlow from the website and uncompress it, or get it 
    from the SVN server.

  Run ./configure from the gridflow directory. Make sure it 
    detects all the components you want to use with GridFlow.
    In MacOS you would normally use FINK to install those extra components:
        ruby libjpeg libjpeg-shlibs libpng-shlibs libpng3 libpng3-shlibs
        libmpeg libmpeg-shlibs

    In Debian (we tried lenny) or Ubuntu (we tried 8.04 ... 10.04), do
	apt-get install libjpeg62-dev libpng12-dev libmpeg3-dev libquicktime-dev fftw3-dev
	apt-get install libaa1-dev libsdl1.2-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev g++ ruby nasm
	apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxt-dev libv4l-dev libcv-dev
	apt-get install libglib1.2-dev
     or apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

    At least with Ubuntu you can add those, but haven't tried with Debian yet:
	apt-get install libcv-dev libdc1394-13-dev

	Note: you may have to set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH
to indicate where to find *.h files, and you 
may have to set both LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to indicate where to find 
*.so or *.a or *.dylib or *.bundle or *.dll or *.lib files.

For example, if m_pd.h is found in /Users/pierre/include, you would do this to access it:

	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/Users/pierre/include

You can do this in a bash shell (in which case it will have effect
on this instance of the shell until it is closed) or you can do
this in .bashrc (in which case it will have effect on all shells started
in the future)

Alternately you could copy m_pd.h into /usr/include
(note: /usr is not visible from Finder)


	Note: you can do ./configure --help to get a list of supported 
options. You can use them to ignore the presence of troublesome libraries 
and select debugging level. With --use-compiler you should use a version of g++, not 
directly a version of gcc, else you get undefined symbol problems. Some versions of gcc/g++ 
are troublesome.

	Note: starting with GridFlow 0.9.6, the --no-gem08 and --no-gem09 (etc) options don't exist
anymore. Instead use --no-opengl if you want to disable GEM support.

	Run make to produce the executables gridflow.so and gridflow.pd_linux or similar 
	Loading GridFlow:
		PureData : With a text editor, modify or create ~/.pdrc and write -lib gridflow.  
		DesireData : In "Server Preferences", add gridflow to the list of libraries. 
Note that on MacOS the dot-files are invisible in the Finder but you do cd ~/Desktop; ln -s ../.pdrc "PureData Configuration" to make an alias on the Desktop. 
Note also that on Windows the dot-files are even more trouble.

| Other Tips

	you just did a SVN update and now the program does not compile, or 
	crashes, or changes didn't go through. 
		When some kinds of changes have happened, you may have to rerun the configure 
	program before redoing make. If you had previously reconfigured with specific options, 
	don't forget to use them again in this case.
		Maybe matju forgot to upload part of an important change. Tell him. 
	PureData Crashing: 
		run start Pd from within the debugger using gdb $(which pd) then run then cause the crash.
		In GDB, after a crash, you can use the where to find out what Pd was doing at the moment 
			of the crash. If instead Pd is frozen, you can force it to crash using Ctrl+C in the terminal.
		To quit GDB use the quit command.

  ./abstractions ..... Pd object classes written in Pd
  ./src .............. object classes written in C++
  ./bin .............. programs startable as applications
  ./bundled .......... files from other packages, bundled here for convenience
  ./deprecated ....... old abstractions for backward-compatibility
  ./examples ......... more complex Pd programs showing off more practical uses.
  ./doc .............. complete documentation in HTML, with XML source
  ./doc/flow_classes . help files (.pd)
  ./doc/tutorials .... tutorials
  ./examples ......... more complex Pd programs showing off more practical uses.
                       (this will replace ./pd_examples in the future).
  ./images ........... sample images used by ./examples, ./doc
  ./tests ............ will contain Pd programs that test GridFlow itself.
