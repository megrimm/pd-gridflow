#X text 282 170 This considers the cross-product as a "trilinear" operator
\, in which you do a bilinear product (two consecutive #inner) but
the output is still vectorial.;
#X text 282 217 This can be thought of as multiplying a vector by a
matrix then by a vector \, except that instead of the matrix you have
a 3-D grid so that the end result is a vector too.;
