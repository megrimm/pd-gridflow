Documentation
[ ] remove "format"
[ ] XMLize reference section
[ ] create JMAXML->HTML converter
[ ] validate samples/outside
[ ] validate samples/020
[ ] specify policy for <sample>, <icon>, etc.
[ ] op2: relative speeds
[ ] add credits
[ ] split reference.html into:
	protocol.html operator.html format.html object.html
[ ] document internals
[ ] add explanation of video4jmax vs jmax-videodsp
[ ] things you type verbatim are all in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are all in I blocks
[ ] H5 font-size is smaller than regular P font-size ?
[ ] make real documentation for templates
[ ] recategorize objects+templates together
[ ] find a good XML editor
[ ] create a good DTD/Schema for jMax/v4j/C
[ ] document use of [route grid_end], [route grid_begin]
[ ] document our own release procedures, how our CVS works
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] improve protocol description
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] document asymptotic cpu+memory usage
[ ] document videoNOT4jmax

General
[ ] make FREE() handle #delete as possible
[ ] better error handling
[ ] @print
[ ] how can I write unit tests or contracts?
[ ] MMX memcpy() ?

Computation Objects
[ ] @cartprod (?), @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store (?)
[ ] @export_list, @import~, @export~, @import*, @export*
[ ] see APL/J/NArray/PDL reference
[ ] @queue, as a replacement for double-@store feedback, and such. (?)
[ ] listop, listfold
[ ] @matrix_inverse, @matrix_solve
[ ] @transpose (dimension swapping and/or index reversing)
[ ] bidirectional vector<->int packer/unpacker (in C using metaclass...)

Effects
[!] overlay using alpha channel
[ ] pinch, waves
[ ] pixelize, despeckle
[ ] hue change
[ ] abyss effect
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits) (???)
[ ] HSL <-> HSV <-> RGB <-> YUV
[ ] blinds, 
[ ] split channels, join channels
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] there's a way to double (?) the speed of the cross-fade.
	try interleaving the data and using [@inner]

Structure & Protocol
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; etc... (?!?)
[ ] unary ops: sq
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] copy-on-write and similar tricks
[ ] accept lists as 1D grids directly in constructors

Input/Output
[ ] in-place editing (rw mode)
[ ] implement byte-order support in BitPacking
[ ] add PTC / TinyPTC / SDL support
[ ] x11 shared memory working
[ ] add messages "load", "save" as open,bang,close combos.
[ ] add NTSC<->PAL option
[ ] fix RGB<->BGR<->??? palette issues

File Formats
[ ] Targa write support
[ ] JPEG support
[ ] PNG support (and register ourselves in libpng.org's app list)
[ ] QuickTime support
[!] MPEG support
[!] TCP support
[!] VDSP support
[ ] multi-image (seq) (createable by cat, ar, tar or zip)
[ ] multi-file (multi) (by glob pattern, e.g.: foo*.ppm)
[!] install libmpeg
[ ] design generic grid format (.grid)
[ ] rewinding file
[ ] FileFormat base class + inheritance + pre-written open() code, etc

Java/Swing
[ ] color picker
[ ] gridbox (akin to intbox) or grid edition dialog, etc.
[ ] embedded display
[ ] vector slider (n parallel sliders in one, Dim(n))
[ ] 2d slider
[ ] radial slider (angle chooser)

Bugs
[ ] @video_out causes delayed crash when closing its associated window
[ ] object sending too much data causes *another* object to crash.
[ ] distinguish "mod" and "%" properly (re: rounding)
[ ] @convolve crashes with some bad right-inlet input
[ ] leak in all FileFormat#close
[ ] add alloc-tracing to find all leaks

Misc
[ ] find out what channel the small cam goes on and why it isn't displaying.
[ ] v4j could have a runtime profiler for cpu+memory usage.
