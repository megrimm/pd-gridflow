Unsorted

[ ] [args] loadbang order really, really sucks.
[ ] [gf/error] can't take a list. (see [#is])
[ ] mmx not properly detected anymore (bug in ruby ?)
[ ] [#rzero_space]
[ ] fix grid attribute setters
[ ] list-attrs
[ ] multi-valued attributes in source_filter
[ ] <pob> matju: [hidecursor( marche aussi dans windows contrairement à ce que dit le fichier d'aide.
[ ] <pob> matju: Dans l'index [#to~] apparaît comme hyperlien et non comme objet. Je ne sais pas si c'est volontaire.
[ ] <pob> matju: dans le fichier d'aide de [#posterize] il y a deux [#out window] du coup l'image traitée n'est pas
    affichée. Il n'y a qu'un fenêtre de crée (nommée 'modified') mais c'est l'image d'origine qui y est affichée.
[ ] reform GFDP so that pd43 and l2ork become debuggable.
[ ] note-help : something wrong with speedlim ? ask patrice (see courriel 7 nov 2010)
[ ] memalign still doesn't exist on OSX and Windows ?
[ ] reverify gem.cxx on OSX Intel-vs-PPC. Did I see a problem with 3 channels again ?
[ ] "seedless" should be really skipping over the seed. but this didn't improve speed for [#fold].
    so, I didn't continue the job on [#scan] [#inner] (note that [#inner] already a special case related to that)
[ ] [#see] shm : http://wiki.tcl.tk/2999
[ ] [gf/mouse_spy] bug with ... was it gop ? (didn't finish writing this line)
[ ] #background_model plante
[ ] rajouter les nouvelles patchs de Roman
[ ] option to disable input when in edit-mode, for [#see] and [gf/mouse_spy]
[ ] [#expr] local
[ ] more [#expr] : int rint imodf modf drem fmod size sum Sum
[ ] [fps] doesn't complain about invalid mode name
[ ] see people/jack/main.pd : [#see] sometimes appears when it's not supposed to.
[ ] error: [???] inlet 0 method grid: grid inlet aborting from [(some bogus location)] at 0/48 because of [#border (1 2) (3 4)]
[ ] document "f 1 2 3" as a shortcut grid literal
[ ] [#import] does the same rounding bullshit again, when we want a float grid
[ ] figure out way to share resources like [#text_to_image] and [#in qbert.png] and such, in qbert.pd and others
[ ] should clean the -path thing because /abstractions/ gets saved in the path
[ ] make a clean GridOut::~GridOut. can't make one because ~GridOut often happens after the next GridOut construction.
[ ] [shunt] [route2] [route3] should have their attr-inlet on the right (maybe) or hidden (CLASS_NOINLET) (maybe)
[ ] think about A_LIST, the 'binbuf' selector, the 'list' selector, and the auto-unfolding of list atoms into list messages.
[ ] is outlet_anything2 and pd_anything2 really something we want as a behaviour of [args] ???
[ ] [#many]: add support for non-i grids
    [ ] should the internal grid always stored as float, and then a [#cast] would change it to the user's favourite type ?
[ ] [#many]: add support for abstraction components
    [ ] abstraction component location lookup doesn't uplevel.
    [ ] [gf/object_bbox] doesn't support looking up a [receives] inside the abstraction because it is 'not patchable'
        and because it's not in the same canvas either
    [ ] [gf/object_bbox] can't look in a separate canvas (and it would be better if it could)
        and I want to use a 2nd order GOP to make things easier (avoid mistakes when saving abstraction)
[ ] [#many]: spacing and margins don't get saved when properties-dialogue has not been used
[ ] [#many]: doesn't show little star indicating that file hasn't been saved
[ ] [#many]: add support for [hsl] and [vsl]
[ ] terrible bug in [#store] put_at with feedback and/or grid too big. can crash.
[ ] révision de patchs d'aide compliquées ou mal dites (?), comme [#grade] [#inner] [#outer] ... et autres.
    donner de bons exemples. expliquer par une séquence de cas (ou d'exemple) de plus en plus complexes.
[ ] il y a qqchose qui marche pas dans les patchs d'aide neuves (pas encore rechargées)
[ ] [#from_pix]: yuv in support, yuv out support
[ ] [#from_pix, colorspace y] may have different contrast/brightness because of differences between the two definitions of Y
[ ] when [#from_pix] uses [pix_rgba] or [pix_grey], there is one empty frame of size (0 0 4) instead of the 1st frame. why ?
[ ] accelerate [#outer ignore (0)]
[ ] other invalid command name ".x8f03820.c" not related to hidden [display]
[ ] reduce the amount of sys_gui() to be done by GFDP while idle.
[ ] test negative dimension sizes in grid-literals, [#import], [#pack], [#redim], etc
[ ] alias numops so that they are more pd-like
[ ] make a rounding [# *>>8] ?
[ ] [#fft] sign crash
[ ] [#import] bug (see atelier)
[ ] remove RAISE from grid.cxx, because of all the problems it causes.
    generally, be a lot more careful about exception handling, because
    assuming an operation works, is as troublesome when using throw/catch as when you don't,
    because if you assume an operation works, you're not really _using_ throw/catch.
[ ] unify [print] and [display] source code
[ ] isn't .str().data() evil ?
[ ] turtle.pd
[ ] [#remap_image, cache]. also, if the left-grid of [#store] could be cached in such a case, it could be very much faster.
[ ] [#import (...) f] converts floats to int to float (wtf)
[ ] [#out x11]: picture too big will be rejected by x11-shm and perhaps crash or leak shm (easy to do in #scale_by-help.pd)
[ ] bug: see #fft*-test.pd
[ ] merge threshold.pd, simple_mask.pd, color_detect.pd
[ ] on which classes do we add an attr-outlet ?
[ ] [#in]/[#out]: what happened to frame number in right outlet?
[ ] [doc_cc] [doc_ii] [doc_oo] where $1 is a symbol don't reposition themselves properly.
[ ] go back in all help files and fill in whatever is still missing
[ ] [#draw_polygon] : winding-rule, et multi-rule (ce dernier utile pour dessiner plusieurs polygones à la fois)
[ ] [#draw_polygon] : multi-rule optimisé (a besoin d'une règle de distributivité du type : a+b+b = a+2b
[ ] put_at is lacking some checks for number-of-dims, causing segfault.
[ ] strange problem with [#import] when input size doesn't match output size and object is recreated
[ ] can't handle [args] that come out as grid literals and have to become setter messages.
[ ] conversion from float to int is inconsistent: when to round and when to trunc?
[ ] what to do with [#motion_detection] ?
[ ] videodev,quicktime,etc: height,width vs size : standardise
[ ] [#swap]: convertir un littéral de grille en grille avant de la passer à l'outlet de droite
[ ] [pack] trigger_by (choose which inlets are hot)
[ ] remove last outlet of [#] when it's irrelevant, and don't have a $2 in that case.
[ ] set_mode(6) was removed on 2008.07.11 and never compensated for. what do we do now?
[ ] error: [#io.quicktime in gf_spirals_and_moire.avi]: unknown colorspace 'yuv' (supported: rgb, rgba, bgr, bgrn, yuv, yuva)
[ ] doc attributes: [doc_a] [doc_aa] ?
[ ] regularise Grid[a,b] vs Grid Dim[a,b] vs Dim[a,b] vs a grid of size (a,b) or (a b)... big mess
[ ] distinguish messages vs atoms in this manual
    e.g. [doc_aa] would contain something like [doc_m] but wouldn't have [doc_m] as a subnode.
[ ] [print], [gf/print] bugs : "(", ")", what else...?
[ ] [gf/canvas_loadbang]: is it buggy? (see [doc_h] double-bang problem)
[ ] support "get" in abstractions... automatically, through [args] ? or [attr] ?
[ ] [fps]: translate into pd: "publish if fps>0.001" (to remove outliers)
[ ] [#to_pix] newimage=0 to save CPU time and/or bus time?
[ ] use [args] everywhere it should be used: e.g. [#background_model] but also many more
[ ] [#fold] is slowwww
[ ] #inner doesnt support seeds of size>1, and isn't vecop-compatible, and ...
[ ] #inner could optimise permutation matrices?
[ ] claude wants http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan
[ ] make [#draw_points] or equivalent (with several dot colours)
[ ] [#in libv4l] lacks framerate, tuner, norm, frequency.
[ ] every [doc_bottom] [r $0-r2] message is received 6 times (duplicates)
[ ] retune [#rgb_to_yuv] and [#yuv_to_rgb] and [#greyscale...] etc.
[ ] make single abstraction that replaces all picture converters and more.
[ ] various_effects.pd doesn't completely support greyscale. other patches don't necessarily, either.
    make more efforts to make colorspaces switchable.
[ ] [display] visible outside redrectangle in [doc_h]
[ ] [doc_o] has a bit of a sync problem when creating [doc_oo] (sometimes?)
    this is a [doc_make] bug because not using [gf/canvas_loadbang].
[ ] visfn: if (self->vis & !flag) sys_vgui(".x%lx.c delete %s\n",long(c),self->rsym->s_name);
[ ] add default values in docs (at the framework level)
[ ] introduce automatic type conversion (en utilisant sand.pd comme exemple)
[ ] [route] - 1[shunt] sends a message (bug)
[ ] on n'a pas un vrai [getargs] au niveau du binbuf (ce qui, en soi, n'est pas évident)
    et ça va être compliqué d'éditer les args pour y rajouter vraiment ce qu'on veut.
    (qu'est-ce qu'on fait avec les virgules ?)
[ ] movie api : merge "height" & "width" attributes
[ ] gridflow_gem*.pd_linux : missing error message on load (sometimes) because of sys_load_lib
[ ] [#saturation] is a linear colorspace transform: therefore it could be accelerated just like [#hueshift] could.
[ ] reduce [doc_h] clock again before release !
[ ] uniformise name of 'color' [doc_accolade] vs 'bgcolor' [#many].
[ ] revoir le système de paquetage pour linux.
[ ] [#dim_append] [#dim_prepend] (pas si utiles que ça...?)
[ ] unparse_args, pass_args could be doing more common work, and use a.join(",").
[ ] big bug in rendering of [#type-gui, vertical] (leaves trace of horiz [#type-gui] behind) when not loaded directly from file.
[ ] int64, float64 should be rejected from NumberTypeE \attr and arguments when in --lite mode
[ ] add ro attr support
[ ] fix [#fastblur] wrong size bug
[ ] change description of GridFlow on gridflow.ca and puredata.info
[ ] gem: support greyscale conversions
[ ] commandline version of shoot.pd craps out sometimes, eating all RAM...
[ ] [#out grid]: cast et type...?
[ ] go through all examples again, to see whether everything works.
[ ] [#in] [#out]: autoclose is currently not considered as an attribute.
[ ] [doc_link] doesn't use [doc_iemfont]
[ ] harmonise help files of [#in] [#out] [#io.*] and introduce help files for abstract 'standardised' interfaces such as
    'window', 'movie', 'image', 'camera', talking about common options... (re)move superfluous parts of [#in].
[ ] PtrOutlet() : replace error() by RAISE() if you can
[ ] [display] [print]: distinguer les () de symboles vs les () de A_LIST
[ ] error: [#store] inlet 0 method float: must have at least 1 dimension. ~GridOut(): dex=0 prod=1
[ ] reintroduce numop1. split number.cxx into numop1.cxx and numop2.cxx. numop1 will be used in both [#] and [#expr].
[ ] merge << and pd_oprint please
[ ] infinite loop in shoot.pd
[ ] change numop to numop2 all over the documentation
[ ] renommer t_symbol * à symbol ou Symbol, et t_atom2 à atom ou Atom ? (peux pas renommer t_atom2 *)
[ ] #fold and #scan begin without seed but can't send "seed none" to [#fold +]
[ ] error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (in has float32\; r has int32)
    pourrait devenir :
    error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (inlet 0 has float32, inlet 1 has int32)
    ou:
    error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (left is float32, right is int32)
    (ou autre)
[ ] make this work in the future :
    error: [#for 0 0] inlet 0 method set: can't convert to grid: \\\\a(A_GRIDOUT 0x90ca8e0)
[ ] intégrer -lib segfault
[ ] [lb] ?
[ ] finish adding PD_BLOBS A_BLOB class_addblob support (have to check for vanilla at runtime, etc.)
[ ] think about link between multidimensional [#for] and future [#decode] (or is it [#encode] ?)
[ ] allow direct passing of a grid as an atom of type Grid instead of just GridOut.
[ ] in case of some camera problems, [#camera] says OFF even when it's not closed.
[ ] regular dc1394 options
[ ] irregular dc1394 options: white_shading, white_balance; trigger_mode? trigger, trigger_delay
[ ] test accuracy of RGB2Y etc
[ ] [#camera] [#cast] setting ? or not ?
[ ] fix SDL modifiers
[ ] GSlice (both the one in GLib and http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/valarray/gslice/ )
[ ] automated loadtime patch rewriting in order to get rid of deprecated forms (?)
[ ] DimConstraint could become a lot better than just the current CONSTRAINT() thing.
[ ] [#out x11]: add 'rootsize' ro attr
[ ] try to fix value of [tsctime]. divide initial tsc test by a [realtime] result ? or just redefine [tsctime] as giving
    a value in million cycles or something.
[ ] look at [pdgst] and [pix_pix2gst]
[ ] [gf/class_info]: add class-list, attr types, arg types, superclasses
[ ] make a generic graph tool that can do efficient graphs using grids (?) and can be configured to do things like PMPD
    but can also serve other purposes. And/or start from waves.pd's mask system to make a patch that recycles the wave data
    to make a CHDH-like animations using [gf/gl].
[ ] see [comment] from cyclone
[ ] Dim::T = intptr_t
[ ] canvasdelete
[ ] DEF_OP(clipunder, a<0?0:a>=b?b-1, 0, false, false)
[ ] DEF_OP(pingpong,  ...)
[ ] custom m_pd.h
[ ] runtime or compiletime check for l2ork (preferably runtime). use it in the customised m_pd.h.
[ ] can't get dllimport/dllexport for windows to work (should look at http://oldwiki.mingw.org/index.php/sample%20DLL )
[ ] win32 color_correction.pd crash
[ ] win32 [#from_pix] et/ou [#out sdl] : crash en essayant d'aller chercher des vidéos avec [pix_video] ou [pix_film]
[ ] win32 x11 support

Not Important
[ ] systematise like is_atom_sel(symbol) is true for float, symbol, pointer, and perhaps blob and grid
    and is_base_sel(symbol) also would include bang and list.
[ ] [#inner] nonscalar seeds ?
[ ] [#scan] could use the same yn==1 optimisation that [#fold] uses
[ ] reenable numop1 isinf finite isnan
[ ] [gf/numop_info]
[ ] algebraïc properties of some numop2s are not written down (0,false,false instead)
[ ] heat.pd still sucks (?)
[ ] cellular_1d.pd: should get a variable width
[ ] [#in unicap] and/or [#in videojack] ?
[ ] [#draw_polygon] : some more weirdnesses in rendering. play a bit with #draw_polygon-test2.pd to see.
[ ] fix warnings in config.log on OSX
[ ] [#find]
[ ] http://claudiusmaximus.goto10.org/cm/2010-12-15_histogram_equalization.html

OpenCV
[ ] cvOpticalFlow
[ ] [cv/#Split]
[ ] cvEstimateRigidTransform
[ ] cvApproxPoly pour un seul poly à la fois
[ ] cvMeanShift, cvCamShift (?)
       cvCamShift s'utilise presque comme MeanShift, sauf que ça requiert un autre type non-grid.
       Celui-ci peut être représenté comme une grille de 5 éléments pour faire plus facile
       (contrairement à cvHistogram, qui contient une grille ND mais a besoin de quelques champs de plus que ça).
[ ] cvCalcBackProject (?)
[ ] cvCalcHist, cvCreateHist.
[ ] SnakeImage
[ ] on doit aussi commencer à rajouter des types non-grid. Le premier sera CvHistogram et est requis pour tous les objets dont le nom contient "Hist".

malloc alignment = 4 mod 8 (en utilisant valgrind)

ClaudiusMaximus matju: feature request:  [#store4], behaves like store but accepts grids of floats as coordinates and
interpolates using 4-point interpolation, eg, right inlet -> (3 3 f # 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 4 8), left inlet -> (1 # 0.5)
outputs (0.5 0.5 0.5) (or whatever the interpolation would really be), left inlet (2 # 1.5 1.5) outputs (3)

[ ] add Minesweeper example based on [#many]
[ ] OpenCL
[ ] encoding of quicktime RGBA (PNG) does not work at all!
[ ] make example on separable convkernels
[ ] add concepts of hot inlet and conf inlet at the code level (?)
[ ] Add a video latency patch (in examples)
[ ] check whether we could benefit more from alignment of data (currently not much)
[ ] rearrange FObject,GridInlet,GridOut structures in a different manner ?
[ ] [#expr] grid support
[ ] [#line]? [#pipe]?
[ ] rewrite [#rgb_to_rgba] [#rgba_to_rgb] in C++ if I'm not going to rework [#inner] soon enough.
[ ] #,#fold,#scan,: option swap
[ ] re-test int64,float64 and make sure it works
[ ] Copy-on-Write (COW)
[ ] internal grid protocol redesigned
[ ] small leak remaining in x11? may have to do with non-use of XDestroyImage?
[ ] is [#convolve] actually cross-correlation ? that is, convolves with a mirror image of the convolution matrix.
[ ] #import with zero size crashes?
[ ] MMX computations may be done misaligned, which may be bad.
[ ] "unsupported codec" bogus errors.
[ ] format/mpeg3.c,quicktime.c might cause lockup on exit
[ ] some seeds aren't typechecked
[ ] GRID_FINISH triggered while backstore ???
[ ] what would be a way to make GF work well with Pd's idea of a list?
[ ] write unit tests about required functionality
[ ] write unit tests about error checking
[ ] make system to ensure everything is working before a release.
[ ] it's possible to crash by sending data in two inlets of a same object at once

Installation
[ ] cross-compile ? http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/ http://rooster.stanford.edu/~ben/linux/cross.php

Documentation
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
[ ] mimic [pdp_help_input] and [pdp_help_output] ?

Architecture
[ ] reentrancy of objects (to allow true recursion)
[ ] expand the [doc_same] concept
[ ] dispatch on _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[ ] generalize the backstore
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator T* makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[ ] accounting: grids packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] memory profiling
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects? (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a way to handle missing data so that we don't have to ever use [#t].
[ ] MMX/SSE in C (remove Asm/Ruby code)
[ ] find a good profiler to use with GridFlow; did I look at http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/about/ ?
    what about: qprofile, amd profiler, opreport -cl --demangle=smart
[ ] read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming

Computation Objects
[ ] #counter (similar to #for)
[ ] zero option in #convolve (as an alternative to wraparound)... sort of a built-in #border
[ ] #convolve should allow n-D convolution
[ ] #store: option zero (?)
[ ] #fold, #scan: option reverse (right-to-left) (is this useful ?)
[ ] #join: option swap
[ ] #matrix_solve (CV), #replace_if, #random_select, #markov_chain, #splice, full-featured #slice (in c++)
[ ] add 2D markov example
[ ] #draw_polygon smoothly
[ ] write a complete benchmark
[ ] spatial biquads (ask Tom)
[ ] implement the whole APL feature set :
    expand, laminate, take, drop, indexof, rotate, generalizedtranspose, deal, decode, encode, membership, format, ...
[ ] #mosaic, #dither, #queue (#delay ?)
[ ] #gaussian_blur, #sobel, #pixelize, #despeckle (median)
[ ] #chroma_key: i0=RGBpicture i1=RGBcolor i2=tolerance o0=RGBApicture
        with fuzzy flag; (don't call it #chroma_key though)
	maybe #mask...
[ ] effectv
[ ] create abstractions for usage patterns (eg: like #remap_image)
[ ] multilinear interpolation a+(b-a)*x+(c-a)*y+(a-b-c+d)*x*y (#scale_by smoothly?)
[ ] #scale_by/#downscale_by fractional values
[ ] bicubic interpolation
[ ] multilinear interpolation (n-dimensional?)
[ ] #perlin
[ ] #moment could support more than 2 dimensions

Input/Output
[ ] a #store that is persistent (saved in .pd) ?
[ ] Grid: support storage in all six numtypes and perhaps also bpv 1,2,4.
[ ] Grid: text version of the format (?)
[ ] ffmpeg, xine, mplayer
[ ] x11,sdl,aalib: use buffering to synchronise frames at a constant rate.
[ ] x11: double buffering using a Pixmap remote-object, sync frames at constant rate, optionally with the actual vsync of the monitor
[ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams
[ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)
[ ] support for audio in cameras / videodev ... see field vcaps.audios
[ ] lqtgavl

Format
[ ] remaining number type support in formats
[ ] threaded [#in]/[#out] handlers
[ ] put_at/reassign in x11/sdl/quartz
[ ] Generic SHM/MMAP Drivers
[ ] "open grid pipe" and such.
[ ] format grid: "headerless until 10" (text files)
[ ] a way to make GEM/PDP/GF conversions *implicitly* instead of having objects for that (?)
[ ] is there anything else deserving to be unified between the video plugins?
[ ] look at camorama
[ ] Generic Image Library: http://opensource.adobe.com/gil/html/giltutorial.html

User Interface
[ ] better [#color]
[ ] 2d cartesian slider (see [grid]); radial slider (angle chooser); polar slider (angle chooser + amplitude chooser)
[ ] object construction menu specialized for each class (generated from class reflection/metadata)

OSX:
[ ] [#io.quicktimeapple] déboguer farfisa_2.mov
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] minsize, size, maxsize
[ ] unifier les décodeurs de colorspaces dans tous les modules de caméra, et les accélérer
[ ] [#io.quartz] fullscreen mode
[ ] [#io.quicktimeapple out] grid, codec, quality.
[ ] http://lists.puredata.info/pipermail/pd-list/2010-04/077455.html
[ ] regarder dans externals/template/ pour voir si on peut y récupérer quoi que ce soit
    par exemple, les binaires gras pour 3 cpus.
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] crash when opening busy camera (?) or is it when opening two cameras at once ?
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] framerate (parce que QuickTime donne des frames en double quand le métro est trop vite)
    (et parce que sur un ordi que je viens d'essayer, on détermine qu'on a juste 15 fps pcq quand le métro est plus
     vite, la détection de mouvement de various_effects.pd fait un clignotement. est-ce qu'on peut vraiment avoir 30 fps
     présentement ? est-ce que ça dépend de la dernière app qui a ouvert la caméra avant gridflow ? faire des tests avec
     [pix_video] et [#camera] en alternance.)

Peines Perdues:
[ ] pd n'a pas d'inlets hybrides comme [tabwrite~]. ça empêche d'envelopper [tabwrite~] avec une abstraction, par exemple.
[ ] [#many]: add support for 'floatatom' objects ?
    (no: we require method 'pos'. apart from that we could work around the lack of 'send', 'receive')
[ ] ps3eye problem (see gridflow-dev 17 mai 2010) (wtf)

Tom Schouten wrote: «added demo/rawvideo.pf and some support scripts in bin/pf-rawvideo.*; this is an example on how to
use external programs for raw video input. rationale: mplayer is a very nice piece of software supporting virtually any
input format/codec. since i'm not planning to waste time on integrating more input codecs in pf, the best alternative is
to have mplayer (actually mencoder) or ffmpeg as a subprocess. the same will be done for recording later.»
