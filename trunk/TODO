Installation
[ ] add --fast switch to turn  on all optimizations
[ ] add --slow switch to turn off all optimizations

Documentation
[ ] update install.html for new "configure" script.
[ ] review reference.html
[ ] review images of reference.html
[ ] add some context info: what is jmax and where to get it
	and where are the mailing-lists and irc channels.
[ ] add explanation of video4jmax vs jmax-videodsp
[ ] add credits
[ ] things you type verbatim are in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are in I blocks
[ ] change title bar
[ ] validate samples/outside
[ ] validate samples/020
[ ] add doc for: ** tanh atan gamma

General
[!] remove memory leaks, segmentation faults
[ ] make FREE() handle #delete as possible
[ ] better error handling
[ ] @print
[ ] @literal
[ ] how can I write unit tests?

Computation Objects
[!] @inner, @outer, @fold, @cartprod (?)
[!] @convolution
[!] @redim (APL bin rho)
[ ] @iota and/or @for
[ ] @resync (fast version of @export followed by @import)
[!] @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store
[!] uint8 option in @store
[ ] @import~, @export~ (note:
	DSP->Control is feasible
	Control->DSP would be *very* kludgy)
[ ] try to manually unroll some loops

Effects
[!] blur
[!] motion-blur (with or without feedback)
[!] fire
[!] ripple
[!] overlay using alpha channel
[ ] emboss, find edges, solarize, pinch, waves
[ ] sharpen, pixelize, despeckle
[ ] gamma correction
[ ] *real* saturation, and hue change
[ ] abyss effect
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits)
[ ] HSL <-> HSV <-> RGB <-> YUV
[ ] blinds, 
[ ] split channels, join channels
[ ] see gimp for ideas

Structure & Protocol
[x] packets: output buffering
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; GridInlet,GridOutlet have redundant info, like the
	element counter, etc.
[ ] unary ops: sq
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] copy-on-write and similar tricks

Input/Output
[ ] in-place editing (rw mode)
[ ] implement byte-order, bit-order support in BitPacking
[ ] add PTC support
[ ] add SDL support
[ ] x11 shared memory working
[ ] x11 screen capture
[ ] x11 multi-display
[ ] add messages "load", "save" as open,bang,close combos.

File Formats
[ ] Targa write support
[ ] JPEG support
[ ] PNG support (and register ourselves in libpng.org's app list)
[ ] QuickTime support
[ ] MPEG support
[!] multi-image (seq) (createable by cat, ar, tar or zip)
[!] multi-file (multi) (by glob pattern, e.g.: foo*.ppm)
[ ] install libmpeg, libquicktime
[ ] design generic grid format (.grid)

Java/Swing
[ ] Color Picker
[ ] Grid Editor

Bugs
[ ] @video_out causes delayed crash when closing its associated window
[ ] object sending too much data causes *another* object to crash.
[ ] distinguish "mod" and "%" properly (re: rounding)

Misc
[ ] find out what channel the small cam goes on and why it isn't displaying.
