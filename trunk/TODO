"!" is planned for "real soon now"

Distribution
[ ] send mail about name change
[ ] open anonymous cvs
[ ] rearrange both web sites
[ ] prepare gridflow-images-0.4

Installation
[ ] add --fast switch to turn  on all optimizations
[ ] add --slow switch to turn off all optimizations
[ ] add --no-profiler and non-pentium autodetect

Documentation
[!] project_policy.xml
[ ] validate samples/outside
[ ] specify policy for <sample>, <icon>, etc.
[ ] add credits
[ ] split reference.*ml into: elements.*ml objects.*ml formats.*ml
[ ] document internals
[ ] add explanation of gridflow vs videodsp
[ ] things you type verbatim are all in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are all in I blocks
[ ] find a good XML editor
[ ] document use of [route grid_end], [route grid_begin]
[ ] document our own release procedures, how our CVS works
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] improve protocol description
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] document asymptotic cpu+memory usage
[ ] document gridflow-for-C
[ ] scan for unused/useless images

General
[ ] make FREE() handle #delete as possible
[ ] better error handling
[ ] @print
[x] how can I write unit tests or contracts?
[ ] MMX memcpy() ?
[ ] runtime configurable packet_length
[ ] there's a type called "GridFlow". This is confusing.

Computation Objects
[ ] @cartprod (?), @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store (?)
[!] @export_list
[ ] @import~, @export~, @import*, @export*
[ ] see APL/J/NArray/PDL reference
[ ] @queue, as a replacement for double-@store feedback, and such. (?)
[ ] @matrix_inverse, @matrix_solve
[ ] @transpose (dimension swapping and/or index reversing)
[ ] bidirectional vector<->int packer/unpacker (in C using metaclass...)
	will replace @two, @three, @four.

Effects
[!] overlay using alpha channel
[ ] pinch
[ ] pixelize, despeckle
[ ] hue change
[ ] abyss effect
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits) (???)
[ ] HSL <-> HSV <-> RGB <-> YUV
[ ] blinds, 
[ ] split channels, join channels
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] there's a way to double (?) the speed of the cross-fade.
	try interleaving the data and using [@inner]

Structure & Protocol
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; etc... (?!?)
[ ] unary ops: sq
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] replace #idle by #busy
[ ] identify streams by ids given at grid_begin
    (may allow for cancelling rejected grids?)
    (add cancel option to the r/rw choice in callback of grid_begin ?)

Input/Output
[ ] in-place editing (rw mode)
[ ] implement byte-order support in BitPacking
[ ] add Hermes support
[ ] add messages "load", "save" as open,bang,close combos.
[x] add NTSC<->PAL option
[ ] allow to select tv channels (this is "freq")
[ ] fix RGB<->BGR<->??? palette issues
[!] should disable x11 shared memory on remote displays.
[!] arguments to @in,@out could be a auto-open.

Formats
[!] Targa write support
[ ] JPEG support
[!] PPM P3    support
[!] PGM P2,P5 support
[ ] PBM P1,P4 support
[ ] XBM support
[ ] XPM support
[ ] PNG support (and register ourselves in libpng.org's app list)
[ ] QuickTime support
[x] MPEG support
[!] Better MPEG support
[x] TCP server
[x] non-blocking read
[!] non-blocking write
[!] non-blocking listen
[!] VDSP support
[!] multi-image (seq) (createable by cat, ar, tar or zip)
[ ] multi-file (multi) (by glob pattern, e.g.: foo*.ppm)
[!] rewinding file (or not)
[!] Format base class + inheritance
[x] Format pre-written open() code
[x] single alarm for X11.
[x] single alarm for GridFlow.

Java/Swing
[ ] color picker
[ ] gridbox (akin to intbox) or grid edition dialog, etc.
[ ] embedded display
[ ] vector slider (n parallel sliders in one, Dim(n))
[ ] 2d slider
[ ] radial slider (angle chooser)

UnitTesting/Bugs
[ ] @out causes delayed crash when closing its associated window
[ ] distinguish "mod" and "%" properly (re: rounding)
[ ] leak in all FileFormat#close (?)
[ ] add alloc-tracing to find all leaks
[ ] TCP server socket busy even after kill

Misc
[ ] find out what channel the small cam goes on and why it isn't displaying.
