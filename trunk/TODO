Architecture
[ ] Add simple C preprocessor to add multi-line strings
    (because of rb_eval_string ?)
[6] C Stream -> Ruby IO/File/TCPSocket
[6] C GridHandler -> Ruby GridHandler
[6] C Format -> Ruby GFFormat
[6] 0. Design the GF-1.0 architecture (new internals documentation)
[6] 1. Single-Message Grids (grid_begin,grid_flow,grid_end -> grid)
	identify streams by ids given at grid msg
	(may allow for cancelling rejected grids?)
	(add cancel option to the r/rw choice in callback of grid msg ?)
[6] 2. Replace Object/Class/List/Dict/Stream by libruby.so
[6] 3. Publish interfaces to Ruby side (scriptability)
[ ] replace current macro system by SWIG or Inline.rb ?
[ ] better error handling
[ ] @print
[ ] MMX memcpy() ?
[ ] runtime configurable packet_length
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; etc... (?!?)
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] make @store loopable
[ ] MMX autodetection
[ ] MMX computations integration
[ ] accounting: grids messages packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] more profiling?
[ ] allow lists to appear in object constructors
[ ] add special list syntax allowing for automatic @redim to n-d grid
	{3 3 | 1 0 0 0} will create unit matrix, etc.
[ ] pull mode (functional-style)
[ ] bidirectional messages (constraint/relational-style)
[ ] send-reply messages (imperative-style)
[ ] replace whine() by post() everywhere
[ ] add reflection (@global#classes, @global#methods, ...)
[ ] add ~/.gridflow_startup

Computation Objects
[ ] @type, @cast
[ ] @cartprod (?)
[ ] @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store (?)
[ ] @import~, @export~
[ ] @import*, @export*
[ ] see APL/J/NArray/PDL reference
[ ] @queue, as a replacement for double-@store feedback, and such. (?)
[7] @scan
[ ] @foldr, @scanr
[7] @inner is broken but useful; rename to @inner2; add real @inner
[ ] @polygon
[ ] @matrix_inverse, @matrix_solve
[7] @sort ?
[7] @transpose: dimension swapping
[ ] @reverse (on given dimension number)
[ ] bidirectional vector<->int packer/unpacker (in C using metaclass...)
	will replace @two, @three, @four.
[ ] timelines as in MM-Director
[ ] @replace_if

Effects
[ ] improve
[ ] overlay using alpha channel
[ ] pinch
[ ] pixelize, despeckle
[ ] abyss effect
[ ] @dither
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits) (???)
[ ] HSV<->RGB; hue shifting
[ ] HSV<->HSL
[ ] RGB<->YUV
[ ] effectv
[ ] blinds, ...
[ ] create templates for usage patterns
[ ] split channels, join channels
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] there's a way to double (?) the speed of the cross-fade.
	try interleaving the data and using [@inner]

Input/Output
[ ] in-place editing (rw mode)
[ ] implement byte-order support in BitPacking
[ ] add Hermes support
[ ] add messages "load", "save" as open,bang,close combos.
[ ] arguments to @in,@out could be a auto-open.

[7] PureData bridge
[ ] Max bridge
[ ] Gimp bridge
[ ] Gnome/Gstreamer bridge

[7] TCP: non-blocking write
[7] TCP Socket Buffering
[7] Grid: bpv 1,2,4,16,64
[7] Grid: signed/unsigned
[ ] MacOSX-Quartz, Win32-GDI, Win32-DirectX ?
[ ] SDL, PTC, TinyPTC ?

Format
[ ] all: possibly get rid of the "format" notion ?
[ ] all: rewinding file (or not)

[ ] PNM: P1,P2,P3,P4,P5 support
[ ] XBM, XPM
[ ] GIF, JPEG, PNG support (+ reg ourselves in libpng.org's applist)
[ ] libquicktime.so, more libmpeg3.so
[ ] fork: is a new format, for e.g. multiple MPEG drivers
[ ] Videodev: allow to select tv channels (this is "freq")
[ ] Videodev: fix RGB<->BGR<->??? palette issues
[ ] Videodev: find out what channel the small cam goes on and why it isn't displaying.
[ ] Raw: a new format for reading arbitrary data.
[ ] Common message-passing format (includes other things than grid)
[ ] X11: mouse input
[ ] /dev/dsp
[ ] /dev/mixer
[ ] Generic SHM Driver
[ ] Generic MMAP Driver
[ ] Unix-for-jMax

jMax-UI
[ ] color picker
[ ] gridbox (akin to intbox) or grid edition dialog, etc.
[ ] embedded display
[ ] vector slider (n parallel sliders in one, Dim(n))
[ ] 2d slider
[ ] radial slider (angle chooser)

Bugs
[ ] format_x11 causes delayed crash when closing its associated window
[ ] format_x11 causes crash (resizing + shm, sometimes)
[ ] distinguish "mod" and "%" properly (re: rounding)
[ ] TCP server socket busy even after kill
[ ] make better detection of libmpeg version
[ ] detect and reject .a linkage
[ ] possibly remove Number and sizeof(Number) (often does not make sense)
[ ] write unit tests about required functionality
[ ] write unit tests about error checking
[6] Window does not close when @out is destroyed
[6] profiler is broken
