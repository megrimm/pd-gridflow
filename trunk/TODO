General
[ ] autoconf
[ ] INCLUDE UP-TO-DATE DOC!!!
[ ] UPDATE "samples/" !!!!
[ ] remove memory leaks, segmentation faults
[ ] better error handling

Computation Objects
[ ] @@ (binary op with array right-operand) (???)
[ ] @fold
[ ] @convolution
[ ] @redim, @dim (APL rho)
[ ] @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store
[ ] @import~, @export~
	note: DSP->Control is ok, but Control->DSP may be kludgy

Effects
[ ] blur, emboss, find edges, solarize, pinch, waves
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] abyss effect, fractals
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits) ???
[ ] alpha channel overlays
[ ] RGB <-> RGBA

Structure & Protocol
[x] packets: output buffering
[ ] grid_end message
[ ] check for too-short / too-long data vs. proposed dims.
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; GridInlet,GridOutlet have redundant info, like the
	element counter, etc.
[ ] binary ops: ** rev%
[ ] binary ops: mod revmod
[ ] binary ops: < == > <= != >= << >>
[ ] binary ops: *sin (a * sin(b / big_constant))
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] copy-on-write and similar tricks
[ ] conditional binary ops ?

Input/Output
[x] remove "int" feature from @video_in_file
[ ] remove perror()
[ ] remove size from constructor of @video_out_file, @video_in_file
[ ] in-place editing
[ ] implement byte-order, bit-order support in @video_out
	(need alternate hardware to test that)
[ ] add PTC support
[ ] x11 shared memory working
[ ] x11 screen capture
[ ] Expose events
[ ] Window close events
[ ] Video4linux support
[ ] files: multi-image (seq), multi-file (multi)
[ ] Targa support
[ ] JPEG support
[ ] QuickTime support

================
vin_file_test_2.jmax
0.2.0.pre3: 20 frames in 30 seconds.
0.2.0.pre8: 20 frames in  8 seconds (packet=16)
0.2.0.pre8: 20 frames in  4 seconds (packet=1k)

store3:
	28,36,128
	336,557,140
	179,15,183

what if I wanted to delay the various parts of the frame differently ? ie.
the pixels in the center are delayed 1 frame ......... and the pixels on
the ourside are delayed 25 frames ........; everything in the middle is
delayed discreetly between these 2 values.
