Here's the file to list the authors of the pictures

b001.jpg, r001.jpg:
  Eyewire Catalogue, 1999 or before. It should be checked
  whether there still exists a copyright on this, because
  the original provider has disappeared (bankruptcy??)
  several years ago.

babbage.jpg :
 (check provenance)
Charles Babbage (1791-1871) is widely regarded as the first computer pioneer and 
the great ancestral figure in the history of computing. Babbage excelled in a variety of 
scientific and philosophical subjects though his present-day reputation rests largely 
on the invention and design of his vast mechanical calculating engines. His 
Analytical Engine conceived in 1834 is one of the startling intellectual feats of the 
nineteenth century. The design of this machine possesses all the essential logical 
features of the modern general purpose computer.

  Researchers in infographics have extensively used that
  picture without necessarily asking for copyright, and
  apparently Playboy doesn't mind.

teapot.png:
  Researchers in infographics have also extensively used
  that picture (actually the wireframe model). This is
  (afaik) the original model, produced in the 1970's (?)
  by one such researcher, and then was rendered in the
  1990's using the Povray raytracer, and then bundled as
  teapot.ppm in Tcl/Tk, and finally in 2001 I grabbed
  that picture 

test.mpeg:
  unknown origin. Too small to be copyrightable.

tux.tga.gz:
  unknown origin.
