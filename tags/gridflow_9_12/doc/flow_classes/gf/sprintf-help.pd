#X text 232 608 %ld %lld %hd %hhd and other variants of the same kind
(with l ll h hh L q j z t) are not supported and rejected. They don't
make sense in the context of Pd anyway.;

not supported \, but if you find a reason to support them \, contact
gridflow-dev.;

#X text 232 949 a single symbol \, no reparsing. if you want a grid
output instead \, look at [#sprintf].;
#X text 232 39 very good replacement for [makefilename] \, [zexy/makesymbol]
\, and [cyclone/sprintf].;
#X text 233 76 Supports most of the sprintf features that are rejected
by other externals.;
#X text 232 451 [gf/sprintf] (and relatives [#sprintf] and [gf/error])
is the only sprintf implementation for pd that supports %*d \, %.*d
\, %*.*d and such \, that is \, the placeholders for field width.;
#X text 232 656 [gf/sprintf] could eventually support custom format
specifiers filling needs that are specific to pd. if you have ideas
\, contact gridflow-dev.;
#X text 232 312 relative to the sprintf man page \, every "double"
(big float) argument comes straight from a float argument in your list
\, every int argument is converted from a float argument in your list
\, every char* argument is converted from a symbol (or float) argument
in your list \, whereas int* arguments \, void* arguments and other
arguments are not supported. if the wrong kind of element is encountered
\, or if there are not enough elements \, an error will be produced
instead. currently \, it's not an error to have too many list elements
\, but it could become one.;

#X text 232 704 [gf/sprintf] has no field width limit other than the
one of sprintf() \, whereas cyclone prevents anything bigger than %256s.
;
#X text 232 752 [gf/sprintf] also does not have any size limit in the
output. [makefilename] crashes after 1000 bytes (that usually means
around 1000 characters). beware that many objects have a 1000 character
limit bug \, including many pd internal classes \, many external classes
\, but not GridFlow classes.;
#X text 232 560 all other features of sprintf() from <stdio.h> are
supposed to be supported. this was coded by reading a version of "man
