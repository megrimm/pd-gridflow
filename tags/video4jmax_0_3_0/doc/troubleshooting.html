<ul>
<li>corrupted jMax file
	<ul>
	<li>FTP transfer in ASCII mode
		<ul>
		<li>this mode assumes you are passing plain-text files.
			it filters out windows-style end-of-lines.
			the jMax format (".jmax") is not plain-text,
			and so, important bytes get removed from the file.
		<li>solution: use binary mode.
		</ul>
	<li>CVS update
		<ul>
		<li>CVS assumes text files in which it makes sense to
			merge file differences together. this normally
			results in update-conflict and corruption on jMax
			files.
		<p>
			Your previously working file is renamed as hidden
			file with a ".#" prefix. The new working file is
			available by removing the corrupted one and doing
			cvs update again.
		<p>
			The worst thing you can do is actually check-in
			a damaged file, in which case you'll have to peek
			an older version and check-in that file.
