#X text 13 348 Objects are like filters \, they change the way messages
flow through them.;
#X text 13 153 You can think of a patch as plumbing. The way water
flows through the plumbing of your house \, messages flow through the
connections in your patch. Objects change the flow of the messages
to allow different things to happen. Messages always go into objects
at the top \, called the inlet \, and always come out at the bottom
\, called the outlet. In PD messages flow from top to bottom.;
#X text 458 236 This is a very simple example of a patch \, the message
"10" can be sent through the "pd this is an object" and can be seen
being passed out the outlet.;

#X text 13 252 You can work with PD in two ways \, the first is in
"edit mode". Edit-mode is where you create your patch by adding objects
and the connections between them. "Run mode" is when you're done with
the construction of your patch \, and you wish to send messages through
it. In run-mode your cursor is an arrow (as it is right now since we
are in run-mode) \, in edit-mode your cursor is a pointing hand.;
#X text 458 136 Messages are what allow objects to communicate with
one and other. Messages can change the way an object acts \, and/or
express the work the object is doing. Messages come in different types.
They can contain words \, numbers and groups of these. The main types
of messages we will be dealing with are floats (numbers). You can click
on a message \, when in run-mode \, to send it through your patch.

#X text 457 67 GUI objects allow you to interact with your PD patch
as it is running. They allow you to change what your patch is doing
without reconnecting the objects. The simplest GUI object is the "Message"
that simply contains a message you want to send in your patch.;
#X text 453 290 A patch that connects a GUI to an object to a second
GUI.;
#X text 531 320 <- This GUI sends a float message (click on it);
#X text 13 66 When working with PD you are dealing primarily with objects
\, GUI (Graphical User Interface) objects \, connections and messages.
These are the building blocks of PD programming. When you connect objects
\, GUI objects \, and messages you are creating a "patch". Patching
is making something complex out of smaller building blocks.;
