#X text 12 20 DESCRIPTION: Using PD to create your first patch;
#X text 13 46 Adding Objects:;
#X text 19 75 In order to create a patch you need to first place objects
and GUI objects \, and second make connections between these objects.
To place an object you need to be in "edit-mode". You should now be
in run mode \, so please go to the "Edit" pull-down menu and choose
"Edit mode" at the bottom. You should see your cursor change from an
arrow to a pointing hand.;
#X text 19 175 SHORTCUT: You can press "Control" and "e" simultaneously
in order to toggle (switch) between edit and Run modes.;

#X text 19 355 SHORTCUT: You can press "Control" and "3" simultaneously
in order to place a number. All shortcuts are listed next to the items
in the "Put" menu.;
#X text 453 366 Patch work area:;
#X text 19 215 Once you are in "edit-mode" you are now free to place
objects. To place an object go to the "Put" pull-down menu and choose
"Number". Once you have chosen this menu item you will see that a "number"
gui is attached to your mouse pointer. In order to place the number
into the patch move your pointer to the grey area to the right (in
the "Patch work area" -> Click once to release it from your mouse.
Note that the number is coloured blue. The blue colour shows that an
item in your patch is selected. To unselect any item simply click once
on the blank (white) space between items.;

#X text 453 156 Connecting Objects:;
#X text 19 411 Next we're going to place the familar "print" object
beneath the "number" GUI. Press "Control" and "1" to place an object
box. Again the object gets attached to your mouse and again click once
to place it in the patch area somewhere under the "number".;
#X text 459 41 While the number box is still selected (coloured blue)
you can see a flashing cursor. Type the word "print" into the object
box. The object will retain a dashed line while you type. In order
to create the object you simply need to unselect \, by clicking somewhere
outside the object. Note that once you have clicked to create the object
the dashed line turns solid and an inlet (small rectangle) gets drawn
around the word "print". The objects have now been created!;
#X text 459 185 All connections between objects in PD are created from
outlet to inlet (top to bottom). To start making a connection move
your hand-pointer over the outlet of the "number" gui. When over the
outlet your pointer will change to a circle. When you see the circle
press and hold the mouse button. As you drag (holding the mouse button
down) the pointer you see a line being drawn from the outlet to your
pointer. To attach this connection to another object drag your mouse
to an inlet of another object. The pointer will again change to a circle
and at this point you can release the mouse button. Once released the
objects are now connected! To play with your patch go back into run-mode
and click and drag on the number-box while watching the terminal.;
