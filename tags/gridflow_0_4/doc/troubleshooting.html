<h4>CVS update</h4>
you just did a CVS update and now the program does not compile, or
crashes, or changes didn't go through. 
<ul>
<li>did you forget the "make install" step?
<li>header (.h) file changed
	<p>you must do a "make clean" because all jMax makefiles are
	broken regarding .h files.
<li>new source file (.c) added
	<p>you must rerun "configure". i recommend to do "make clean"
	after that.
<li>maybe matju forgot to checkin an important change.
</ul>

<h4>crashing</h4>
<ul>
<li>you should know where the FTS executable file is. Its filename looks
like "/usr/lib/jmax/fts/bin/i686-linux/opt/fts". we'll call it $FTS now.
<li>if you want to prevent a complete machine crash, you should not run
fts as "root" user, and you should do chmod -s on the $FTS file. i
recommend that you work that way until the fts crash problem is fixed, and
only run it again as root when the only problem left is lack of
smoothness. 
<li>by running the command "ulimit -c unlimited" before starting jmax
(from the same shell) will cause a crash to write the program's RAM into
a file named "core" in the current directory.
<li>you can read this file in a semi-friendly way by doing
"gdb $FTS core" right after that. what you need to do with that is usually
just to type "backtrace" and then "quit". the first command will print a
list of functions active during the crash. the bug is usually in one close
to the top of the list.
</ul>

<h4>corrupted jMax file</h4>
<ul>
<li>FTP transfer in ASCII mode
	<ul>
	<li>this mode assumes you are passing plain-text files.
		it filters out windows-style end-of-lines.
		the jMax format (".jmax") is not plain-text,
		and so, important bytes get removed from the file.
	<li>solution: use binary mode.
	</ul>
<li>CVS update
	<p>CVS assumes text files in which it makes sense to
		merge file differences together. this normally
		results in update-conflict and corruption on jMax
		files.
	<p>
		Your previously working file is renamed as hidden
		file with a ".#" prefix. The new working file is
		available by removing the corrupted one and doing
		cvs update again.
	<p>
		The worst thing you can do is actually check-in
		a damaged file, in which case you'll have to peek
		an older version and check-in that file.
</ul>

<h4>too slow</h4>
<ul>
<li>put often-used files on fast drives. this means don't use NFS
(networked file system) for that. the file->ram cache can compensate for
that up to a certain amount, but the larger the file is, and the most used
the file is, the most important it is to put it on a local drive. 
<li>
</ul>
