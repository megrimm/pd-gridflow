#X obj 97 774 doc_m o0 method;
#X text 232 774 indicates that the class has a method named \$2 in
inlet \$1.;
#X text 232 857 inlet -1 represents methods that exist in all inlets
at once from a single definition. this occurs normally only when there
is a variable number of inlets.;
#X text 232 905 a grid method is listed three times : each grid method
is accompanied by a float method and a list method. If any local float
method or list method is hiding the default method(s) brought by the
grid method \, you will not notice.;
#X text 232 966 "method -2 anything" represents a method that catches
anything in any inlet at once.;
#X text 232 1001 there is currently no way to define a anything in
a single inlet at a time.;
#X text 232 1036 other methods in inlet -2 are for internal use ONLY.
they are not directly reachable from pd.;
#X text 232 796 the constructor (aka creator or new-method) and the
destructor (free-method) are not listed. the dsp-method and perform-function
(for ~ objects) are not listed. however \, the loadbang method is listed.
;
#X text 232 1071 inlet numbers don't correspond in some rare cases
: when the CLASS_NOINLET option is in use \, GF inlet numbers don't
match Pd inlet numbers \, the left inlet will be numbered 1 instead
of 0 \, and inlet 0 will be invisible. GF currently only uses this
for [#from~] \, but may come to use it for [shunt] \, [route2] \, [route3]
and some more.;

#X text 117 105 is weird because GF's framework doesn't support ~ inlets
directly;
#X obj 97 456 doc_m o0 attr;
#X text 232 456 indicates that \$1 is a valid argument to the get-method
\, and that the get-method will output something named like that when
called without arguments.;
#X text 232 504 some attributes are special in some ways that make
them hidden from that list but still supported by 'get'. this co√Øncides
with when 'get' exceptionally appears in the list of methods.;
#X text 232 1158 methods of superclasses are not listed. those are
rare in GF. this mostly just means that 'get' is not listed \, because
it is common to all classes. ('help' was also a common method like
that \, but it was removed in 9.11). it can happen that 'get' is listed
\, when the 'get' of a class has any special cases in it.;
#X text 232 408 if class or alias is not found in GridFlow's class
database. this only covers the C++/source_filter.rb interface \, and
NOT the abstractions.;
#X text 96 51 has variable number of inlets (and doesn't say it);
#X obj 97 613 doc_m o0 inlets;
#X obj 97 1293 doc_m o0 outlets;
#X text 232 613 number of inlets of objects of that class. if the class
has variable number of inlets \, this is the "initial" number of inlets
\, which normally means the minimum possible number of inlets \, even
though that case may not be the most useful nor the default.;
#X text 232 1293 number of outlets of objects of that class. if the
class has variable number of outlets \, this is the "initial" number
of outlets \, which normally means the minimum possible number of outlets
\, even though that case may not be the most useful nor the default.
;
#X text 232 687 if there CLASS_NOINLET \, GF's inlet 0 will not be
visible in Pd \, therefore this number will be one more than reported.
Furthermore \, signal inlets will never be reported because they are
not supported by GF's C++ interface. Anything created using inlet_new
will not be reported (but this only happens in [#from~] at the moment)
;
#X text 232 1367 signal outlets will never be reported because they
are not supported by GF's C++ interface. Anything created using outlet_new
will not be reported (but this only happens in [#to~] at the moment)

#X msg 37 132 symbol #to_l;
#X text 116 131 is an alias;
#X obj 97 1245 doc_m o0 name;
#X text 232 1245 the real name of the class. This may be different
from the symbol being input in case of alias. There is no way to look
up a list of aliases.;
#X obj 97 565 doc_m o0 flags;
#X obj 97 1428 doc_m o0 super;
#X text 232 565 8 means CLASS_NOINLET. This would be a sum of values
\, but currently only CLASS_NOINLET is ever used. Thus 0 means no option
is used.;
#X text 232 1450 the name of the superclass. this usually means an
abstract class that is not registered in pd at all.;
#X text 232 1485 GUI_FObject means that this is a class that has a
t_widgetbehavior. Those are for objects that don't look like objectboxes.
