<section name="Software (and Hardware) you Probably Need">
<p>Required Hardware (One of...):<list>
	<li>i386 : "old" IBM PC, or "new" IBM PC with old compiler</li>
	<li>i686 : "new" IBM PC with recent compiler</li>
	<li>ppc : "new" Macintosh</li>
	<li>armv4l : Corel Netwinder</li>
	<li>mips : Silicon Graphics, non-PC</li>
	<li>sparc : Sun SparcStation</li>
</list>(but we only test i686 ourselves)</p>
<p>Required Software:<list>
	<li>Ruby 1.6.2 or more recent (language interpreter)</li>
	<li>GNU C Compiler (gcc)</li>
	<li>GNU Make (gmake)</li>
</list></p>
<p>Very Recommended:<list>
	<li>jMax 2.5</li>
	<li>jMax 4.0 support in the works</li>
	<li>X11 Display Server and MIT-Xlib (already in linux)</li>
</list></p>
<p>Optional:<list>
	<li>PureData 0.35 or 0.36 (support is experimental)</li>
	<li>Simple Directmedia Layer (sdl)</li>
	<li>Ascii Art Library (aalib)</li>
	<li>HeroineWarrior's libmpeg3.so</li>
	<li>HeroineWarrior's libquicktime.so</li>
	<li>Greg Ward's libmpeg.so ("Berkeley/MNI")</li>
	<li>a digitizer card with a Video4linux 1.x driver (videodev.h)</li>
	<li>Ruby add-on "xmlparser" (for editing documentation)</li>
</list></p>
<p>NOTE: 
for help on installing and compiling jMax, please see Christian Klippel's
extensive help file at <link to="http://www.mamalala.de"/>
as well as the jMax docs.</p>
<p>Also Useful:<list>
	<li>Pentium-compatible CPU (for profiling)</li>
	<li>CVS (for live update)</li>
</list></p>
<p>NOTE:
There are several different incompatible libmpeg's from different authors;
I found four of them, some numbered 2 and 3 as if they were version numbers
(but it seems they are not).
</p>

<p>NOTE: if one of your libraries are only available in .a format, you will not
be able to compile GridFlow. All libraries GridFlow uses must be in .so format.

<section name="Installation process (for jMax 2.5)">
<list>
  <li>if you don't have jMax, get it at
	<link to="http://www.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/jmax/en/index.php3">
	jMax's site
	</link>.
	If have only the RPM, you will need to install this:
	<link to="http://www.artengine.ca/jmax/gridflow/download/jmax-headers-2.5.1.tar.gz">
		jmax headers
	</link>

	in whichever directory as long as you tell it to GridFlow's
	configurator. 

  </li>
  <li>Install Ruby 1.6.6 or any version released in 2002 or later (the
latest from the 1.7/1.8 series work and are faster)  You will need either
<k>libruby.so</k> or <k>libruby.a</k> or <k>libruby-static.a</k>
If you're using an installer and you're missing those files,
then look for another package of a
similar name that may contain extra files (eg: "ruby-dev"). If you're
installing from source code you have to configure with the
<k>--enable-shared</k> option. If you install into a system directory, you
have to recreate the library index using the <k>ldconfig</k> command too
(auto-installers normally do this for you).
  </li>

  <li>Download the latest version of GridFlow
      and download the images pack (gridflow-images-0.5.tar.gz).
      The download site is
	 <link to="http://www.artengine.ca/jmax/gridflow/download">artengine.ca</link>.
      Unpack Gridflow in /usr/local/jmax/packages (or the path of your choice),
      which will create a directory called 'gridflow';
      unpack the images pack into that directory, which will create
	 another one called 'images'.
  </li>

  <li>Run <k>./configure</k> from the <k>gridflow</k> directory. You must have
  jMax's include files in <k>/usr/include</k> (or anywhere covered by
  <k>C_INCLUDE_PATH</k>). <k>./configure</k> will try to detect some optional
  components (libmpeg, pentium clock, etc). In the end, the files
  <k>config.make</k>, <k>config.h</k> and <k>Makefile</k> will be generated.
  </li>

  <li>If you are not running Linux on a PentiumPro-compatible computer, you
  will have to specify a jMax Makefile using the <k>--jmax-arch</k> option.
  This is the one you use when installing jMax (or other jMax plugins other
  than GridFlow) manually. On MacOS 10, this would be <k>ppc-macosx</k>.</li>

  <li>Stay in the same directory and do:
      <list>
        <li><k>make</k></li>
        <li><k>make install</k></li>
        <li><k>make test</k></li>
      </list>
      but if one stops because of "Error" you shouldn't try the next one.
  </li>

  <li>Load <k>~/.jmaxrc</k> (text). Go to the <k>when start</k> section.
  Add a line that says <k>package require gridflow</k>.
  Add this line that says <k>dataDirectory </k><i>gridflow-directory</i><k>/images</k>
  </li>

  <li>(Re)start jMax.</li>

</list>

  <p>Note: you can do <k>./configure --help</k> to get a list of supported
  options. You can use them to ignore the presence of troublesome libraries
  and select debugging level.</p>

</section>

<section name="Installation process (with PureData 0.35 and compatible)">

<list>
<li>make sure <k>m_pd.h</k> is installed and can be seen by the compiler.
you may have to change the C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable.</li>
<li>go in GridFlow's source directory.</li>
<li>run <k>./configure</k></li>
<li>run <k>make</k></li>
<li>run <k>make install</k></li>
<li>run <k>make test</k></li>
<li>run pd with the <k>-path</k> to the extras directory and <k>-lib
gridflow</k>, or put those options in your <k>~/.pdrc</k> file. (this part is
essentially the same as GEM's and PDP's)</li>
</list>

</section>

<section name="Installation process (without jMax)">
<list><li>
	If you don't have jMax installed it won't be detected. Installation
	will proceed normally except that the Ruby-for-jMax bridge won't be
	installed. Try running 'make test'. Look at 'tests/test.rb' for
	an example of how you may use GridFlow without jMax.
