[ ] [#fft] sign crash
[ ] [#import] bug (see atelier)
[ ] remove RAISE from grid.cxx, because of all the problems it causes.
    generally, be a lot more careful about exception handling, because
    assuming an operation works, is as troublesome when using throw/catch as when you don't,
    because if you assume an operation works, you're not really _using_ throw/catch.

[ ] strange problem with [#import] when input size doesn't match output size and object is recreated

OpenCV
[ ] cvOpticalFlow
[ ] [cv.split]
[ ] cvEstimateRigidTransform
[ ] cvApproxPoly pour un seul poly à la fois
[ ] cvMeanShift, cvCamShift (?)
       cvCamShift s'utilise presque comme MeanShift, sauf que ça requiert un autre type non-grid.
       Celui-ci peut être représenté comme une grille de 5 éléments pour faire plus facile
       (contrairement à cvHistogram, qui contient une grille ND mais a besoin de quelques champs de plus que ça).
[ ] cvCalcBackProject (?)
[ ] cvCalcHist, cvCreateHist.
[ ] SnakeImage
[ ] on doit aussi commencer à rajouter des types non-grid. Le premier sera CvHistogram et est requis pour tous les objets dont le nom contient "Hist".

Common Video Framework
[ ] a way to make GEM/PDP/GF conversions *implicitly* instead of having objects for that.
[ ] threads for video?
[ ] GEM geos vs 3DP: how do they compare?
[ ] is there anything else deserving to be unified between the video plugins?
[ ] look at camorama

malloc alignment = 4 mod 8 (en utilisant valgrind)

ClaudiusMaximus matju: feature request:  [#store4], behaves like store but accepts grids of floats as coordinates and
interpolates using 4-point interpolation, eg, right inlet -> (3 3 f # 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 4 8), left inlet -> (1 # 0.5)
outputs (0.5 0.5 0.5) (or whatever the interpolation would really be), left inlet (2 # 1.5 1.5) outputs (3)

[ ] OpenCL
[ ] try removing or modifying -falign on PPC/OSX
[ ] encoding of quicktime RGBA (PNG) does not work at all!
[ ] make example on separable convkernels
[ ] add concepts of hot inlet and conf inlet at the code level (?)
[ ] Add a video latency patch (in examples)
[ ] Numop: warn on misalignment
[ ] remove GridInlet* ?
[ ] [#from~]
[ ] [#expr]
[ ] [#line]? [#pipe]? [#delay]?
[ ] rewrite [#rgb_to_rgba] [#rgba_to_rgb] in C++ if I'm not going to rework [#inner] soon enough.
[ ] #: option swap
[ ] re-enable int64,float64
[ ] Copy-on-Write (COW)
[ ] internal grid protocol redesigned
[ ] look into -ftree-vectorize
[ ] look at Tetra Piccolo capture cards, as well as ImpactVCB (Hauppauge)
[ ] some proper equivalent of [rubysprintf]... see also: [gf/error]
[ ] small leak remaining in x11? may have to do with non-use of XDestroyImage?
[ ] is [#convolve] actually cross-correlation ? that is, convolves with a mirror image of the convolution matrix.
[ ] #import with zero size crashes?
[ ] osx: [#store] crash instead of raising
[ ] MMX computations may be done misaligned, which may be bad.
[ ] when file not found, mpeg error messages are wrong, they say the filename is "".
[ ] osx: error: shmget failed (cannot allocate memory) in X11, for regular pictures
[ ] "unsupported codec" bogus errors.
[ ] format/mpeg3.c,quicktime.c might cause lockup on exit
[ ] some seeds aren't typechecked
[ ] GRID_FINISH triggered while backstore ???
[ ] what would be a way to make GF work well with Pd's idea of a list?
[ ] write unit tests about required functionality
[ ] write unit tests about error checking
[ ] make system to ensure everything is working before a release.
[ ] it's possible to crash by sending data in two inlets of a same object at once

Installation
[ ] cross-compile: http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/ http://rooster.stanford.edu/~ben/linux/cross.php

Documentation
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] document our distribution of the archives
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] describe indexmap (and such types/shapes/uses/roles) in doc
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
[ ] mimic [pdp_help_input] and [pdp_help_output] ?

Architecture
[ ] reentrancy of objects (to allow true recursion)
[ ] expand the [doc_same] concept
[ ] eliminate the Dim class, replacing by Grid itself (?).
[ ] pull mode (functional-style)
[ ] bidirectional messages (constraint/relational-style)
[ ] send-reply messages (imperative-style)
[ ] add reflection (#global:classes, #global:methods, ...)
[ ] dispatch on _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[ ] generalize the backstore
[ ] Outlet#buffer should harmonise with the lcm of its corresponding Inlet#factor's.
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator T* makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[ ] accounting: grids packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] memory profiling
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects? (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a GridFlow::LaterException or something (which tells to retry later with the same packet because another
    grid reception is not completed yet.) 
[ ] interpret nested lists as n-dimensional.
[ ] SSE
[ ] find a good profiler to use with GridFlow; did I look at http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/about/ ?
    what about: qprofile, amd profiler, opreport -cl --demangle=smart

Computation Objects
[ ] #counter (similar to #for)
[ ] zero option in #convolve (as an alternative to wraparound)
[ ] #conv (simpler #convolve) should allow n-D convolution
[ ] #convolve rewritten as combination of #conv+#border ?
[ ] #store: option zero (?)
[ ] #from~
[ ] #fold, #scan: option reverse (right-to-left)
[ ] #join: option swap
[ ] #matrix_solve (CV), #replace_if, #random_select, #markov_chain, #splice, full-featured #slice (in c++)
[ ] #draw_polygon smoothly
[ ] write a complete benchmark
[ ] spatial biquads (ask Tom)
[ ] implement the whole APL feature set
[ ] #mosaic, #dither, #fire, #queue (#delay ?)
[ ] #gaussian_blur, #sobel, #pixelize, #despeckle (median)
[ ] #chroma_key: i0=RGBpicture i1=RGBcolor i2=tolerance o0=RGBApicture
        with fuzzy flag; (don't call it #chroma_key though)
	maybe #mask...
[ ] turtle (logo style)
[ ] effectv
[ ] create abstractions for usage patterns (eg: like #remap_image)
[ ] multilinear interpolation a+(b-a)*x+(c-a)*y+(a-b-c+d)*x*y (#scale_by smoothly?)
[ ] #scale_by/#downscale_by fractional values
[ ] bicubic interpolation
[ ] multilinear interpolation (n-dimensional?)
[ ] #perlin
[ ] #moment could support more than 2 dimensions
[ ] note in the helpfiles what is meant by YUV in gridflow (what colorspace that is)

Input/Output
[ ] a #store that is persistent (saved in .pd) ?
[ ] Grid: support storage in all six numtypes and perhaps also bpv 1,2,4.
[ ] Grid: text version of the format (?)
[ ] ffmpeg, xine, mplayer
[ ] x11,sdl,aalib: use buffering to synchronise frames at a constant rate.
[ ] x11: sync with the actual vsync of the monitor
[ ] x11: double buffering using a Pixmap remote-object
[ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams
[ ] synchronized audio with the video when using mpeg1 & 2
[ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)
[ ] support for audio in cameras / videodev ... see field vcaps.audios

Format
[ ] remaining number type support in formats
[ ] threaded [#in]/[#out]
[ ] put_at/reassign in x11/sdl/quartz
[ ] Generic SHM/MMAP Drivers
[ ] "open grid pipe" and such.
[ ] format grid: "headerless until 10" (text files)

User Interface
[ ] better [#color]
[ ] 2d cartesian slider (see [grid]); radial slider (angle chooser); polar slider (angle chooser + amplitude chooser)
[ ] object construction menu specialized for each class (generated from class reflection/metadata)

    par exemple, les binaires gras pour 3 cpus.
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] crash when opening busy camera (?) or is it when opening two cameras at once ?
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] framerate (parce que QuickTime donne des frames en double quand le métro est trop vite)
    (et parce que sur un ordi que je viens d'essayer, on détermine qu'on a juste 15 fps pcq quand le métro est plus
     vite, la détection de mouvement de various_effects.pd fait un clignotement. est-ce qu'on peut vraiment avoir 30 fps
     présentement ? est-ce que ça dépend de la dernière app qui a ouvert la caméra avant gridflow ? faire des tests avec
     [pix_video] et [#camera] en alternance.)

Tom Schouten wrote: «added demo/rawvideo.pf and some support scripts in bin/pf-rawvideo.*; this is an example on how to
use external programs for raw video input. rationale: mplayer is a very nice piece of software supporting virtually any
input format/codec. since i'm not planning to waste time on integrating more input codecs in pf, the best alternative is
to have mplayer (actually mencoder) or ffmpeg as a subprocess. the same will be done for recording later.»
