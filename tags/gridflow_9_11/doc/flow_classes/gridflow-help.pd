anytime in the future.;
#X text 210 49 get some global attributes of GridFlow.;
#X text 210 73 can also be used to load GridFlow \, if there is the

#X text 232 388 "win32" indicates a MS Windows system (with MinGW layer
for partial posix emulation);
#X text 232 423 "darwin" indicates a MacOS 10 ("Darwin") system. This
has native posix support except for some features that GF doesn't use
directly (such as libdl). This does not normally run X11 (though some
apps may... Pd-OSX does not require X11 since 2004 or so). Lots of
typical linux components are available as part of the base OS \, or
on the developers tools CD \, or in FINK \, or in MacPorts.;
#X text 232 523 "linux" indicates a Linux system \, FreeBSD system
\, or other. This is currently including anything except "win32" and
"darwin". If you need this to be more specific \, contact gridflow-dev.
