#X text 12 20 DESCRIPTION: Using Graph on Parent abstractions;
#X text 13 46 What is Graph on Parent?;
#X text 13 76 Graph on Parent is a feature of PD that allows you to
show the GUI objects contained in an abstraction on the parent patch.
This means that you can create abstractions that not only include a
collection of objects but can also include a user interface. To use
graph on parent you simply need to create an abstraction the usual
way but before saving it you need should Control-Click (Right-Click)
on the background (white area) in the abstraction and choose "properties".
From the properties menu check the "graph on parent" option. Now when
you save the patch and embed it in a second patch all GUI objects will
be visible.;

#X text 13 331 In this simple example there is only one GUI object
\, a slider. Inside the abstraction the slider is connected to an inlet
and an outlet. If you move the slider you can see the result in the
outlet. If you set a value in the inlet with the number GUI you can
see the position of the slider change.;

#X text 13 421 Note you can change the size of the abstractions bounding
box by Control-Click (Right-Click) on the abstraction and choose "properties".
The size of the bounding-box is specified by the "screen width" and
"screen height".;
