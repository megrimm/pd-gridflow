List of undocumented methods in rblti. This includes methods added with %extended in SWIG. 

- RegionsPolygonizer: apply() does not need the maxLabel argument. It is hardwired to the number of 
  labels found in the input imatrix. Therefore, in calls to RegionsPolygonizer, the maxLabel argument is omitted.

- ObjectsFromMask: added an apply() method with the following prototype: 
  ObjectsfromMask::apply(const channel8& inputchannel, const int& minimumsize, channel8& outputchannel)
  The objective of this method is to output a channel where only the largest objects are preserved, reducing the clutter in
  the image.
  where:  inputchannel: binary image containing the blobs to be extracted.
          minimumsize: objects smaller than this size are discarded from the output.
          outputchannel: binary image with only the largest blobs kept.

- FastLineExtraction: an extra apply method with the following prototype has been added:
	void apply(const lti::channel8& chan, std::vector<segmEntry>& list)
        list is a vector whose elements are the segments extracted from the image.
