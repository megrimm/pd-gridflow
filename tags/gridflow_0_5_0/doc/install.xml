<section name="Software (and Hardware) you Probably Need"><prose>
<p>Required Hardware (One of...):<list>
	<li>i386 : "old" IBM PC, or "new" IBM PC with old compiler</li>
	<li>i686 : "new" IBM PC with recent compiler</li>
	<li>ppc : "new" Macintosh (IS NOT SUPPORTED YET - HELP US)</li>
	<li>armv4l : Corel Netwinder (but jMax does not run on this)</li>
	<li>mips : Silicon Graphics, non-PC (only tested without jMax)</li>
</list></p>
<p>Required Software:<list>
	<li>GNU C Compiler (gcc)</li>
	<li>GNU Make (gmake)</li>
	<li>GNU Bash</li>
	<li>X11 Display Server</li>
	<li>X11 Display Library (Xlib)</li>
</list></p>
<p>Very Recommended:<list>
	<li>jMax 2.5</li>
	<li>jMax 3.0 support coming soon</li>
	<li>jMax 2.4 support removed</li>
</list></p>
<p>Optional:<list>
	<li>HeroineWarrior's libmpeg3.so</li>
	<li>Greg Ward's libmpeg.so ("Berkeley/MNI")</li>
	<li>a digitizer card with a Video4linux 1.x driver (videodev.h)</li>
	<li>Ruby 1.6 with package "xmlparser" (for editing documentation)</li>
</list></p>
<p>NOTE: 
for help on installing and compiling jMax, please see Christian Klippel's
extensive help file at <link to="http://www.mamalala.de"/>
as well as the jMax docs.</p>
<p>Also Useful:<list>
	<li>Pentium-compatible CPU (for profiling)</li>
	<li>CVS (for live update)</li>
</list></p>
<p>NOTE:
There are several different incompatible libmpeg's from different authors;
I found four of them, some numbered 2 and 3 as if they were version numbers
(but it seems they are not).
</p>

<p>NOTE: if one of your libraries are only available in .a format, you will not
be able to compile GridFlow. All libraries GridFlow uses must be in .so format.

<section name="Installation process (for jMax 2.5)"><prose>
<list>
  <li>Download the latest version of GridFlow
      and download the images pack (gridflow-images-0.5.tar.gz).
      The download site is
	 <link to="http://www.artengine.ca/jmax/gridflow/download">artengine.ca</link>.
      Unpack Gridflow in /usr/local/jmax/packages (or the path of your choice),
      which will create a directory called 'gridflow';
      unpack the images pack into that directory, which will create
	 another one called 'images'.
  </li>

  <li>Find your system type (for AMD K6 and Pentium Pro and compatibles, 
  on Linux, this is <k>i686-linux</k>; if you have a recent Macintosh, this
  is <k>ppc-macosx</k> or <k>ppc-linux</k>)</li>
  
  <li>Run <k>./configure --jmax25 --arch <i>your-system-type</i></k> from the <k>gridflow</k> directory.
  note: if you didn't install GridFlow in the <k>packages</k> directory,
  then you have to add the option <k>--jmax-dist-dir
  <i>your-jmax-source-directory-goes-here</i></k></li>

  <li><k>./configure</k> will try to detect some optional components (libmpeg,
  pentium clock, etc); error messages may appear in case of a <k>no</k>.
  usually a <k>yes</k> will not show anything else. In the end, the files
  <k>config.make</k>,
  <k>c/src/Sources</k> and
  <k>c/src/config.h</k> will be generated.
  </li>

  <li>Stay in the same directory and do:
      <list>
        <li><k>make all</k></li>
        <li><k>make install</k></li>
      </list>
      but if the first one stops because of "Error" you shouldn't try the second
	 one.
  </li>

  <li>Load <k>~/.jmaxrc</k> (text). Go to the <k>when start</k> section.
  Add a line that says <k>package require gridflow</k>.
  Add this line that says <k>dataDirectory </k><i>gridflow-directory</i><k>/images</k>
  </li>

  <li>(Re)start jMax. </li>

</list>

  <p>Note: If there's a problem with libmpeg anywhere in the process,
  you can add the option --no-mpeg to the configurator.</p>

  <p>Note: If you want more speed, you can configure with the --fast
  switch, which turns off many error-detection mechanisms; if you want
  more speed, you could configure with --no-profiling too, but if you do
  that, you can no longer find out which of the objects consume the most
  time.</p>

</prose></section>

<section name="Installation process (without jMax)"><prose>
	If you are not a C programmer you probably shouldn't do this.
<list><li>
	Use the <k>--nojmax</k> option instead of <k>--jmax25</k>.
	Don't do the regular <k>make all</k>; you can only do a
	<k>make standalone</k>. (note: You can also do <k>make standalone</k>
	when installing with jMax. in any case that command creates 
	<k>c/lib2/libgridflow.so</k> which can be used without jMax).
</li></list>
