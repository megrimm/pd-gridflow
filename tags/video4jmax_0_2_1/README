Designed to work with JMAX 2.5.1, should work with JMAX 2.4.12

Run ./configure from the video4jmax directory and specify --jmax24 or 
--jmax--25, that should take care of adjusting the Makefiles to your
current version and point to the right header for fts. 
 
Files Changed:

	video4jmax/Makefile
  	video4jmax/c/Makefile
        video4jmax/c/src/Makefile
