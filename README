| Hardware and Software you Probably Need

Computer/Processor: GridFlow is mainly made on PC. This includes AMD K6/K7/K8 (Athlon/Opteron/etc), Intel P2/P3/P4 and other Pentiums, Intel CoreDuo, etc.; the absolute minimum is 386. However, it has also been built recently for Macintosh PowerPC (G3/G4/G5) recently.

Operating System: GridFlow is mainly made on Ubuntu. We have also used Debian, SuSE, Mandrake, OSX. Microsoft Windows is not supported, but if you do want to try to add support for that, try CygWin and/or MinGW.

Required Software:
	Ruby 1.8 or 1.9
	PureData 0.40 or later, or DesireData
	GNU C++ Compiler (g++) version 3.x or 4.x
	GNU Make
	SVN
	Developer CD (XCODE) (if using OSX)
	FINK (if using OSX)

Multimedia Components (optional):
	libSDL (Simple Directmedia Layer)
	libjpeg
	libpng
	libmpeg3 (.mpg reader, HeroineWarrior's)
	libquicktime (.mov reader/writer, Burkhard Plaum's or HeroineWarrior's) 
	libmpeg (.mpg reader, Greg Ward's, old)
	Apple QuickTime (.mov reader/writer and camera interface)
	Ascii Art Library (aalib)
	PCI video digitizer card  (and Video4linux 1 driver)
	USB camera (and Video4linux 1 driver)
	FFTW3
	OpenCV
	NetPBM
	OpenGL
	Apple X11 (for 10.3: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11formacosx.html
		   for 10.4: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11update2006113.html )

| Downloading from SVN

The SVN has the absolute latest version of GridFlow, but it's not guaranteed to be working, whereas 
the actual releases are more tested.
However you may have various reasons to use the SVN edition, so here's how:
Make sure you have the <kbd>svn</kbd> program installed.

<kbd>cd pd/extra</kbd>
<kbd>svn checkout http://gridflow.ca/svn/trunk</kbd>
<kbd>mv trunk gridflow</kbd>
And the subsequent times, you only do this:
<kbd>cd pd/extra/gridflow</kbd>
<kbd>svn update</kbd></td></tr>

| Installation instructions (incl. compilation)
	 Install Ruby.
	Download GridFlow from the website and uncompress it, or get it from the SVN server.
	Run <kbd>./configure</kbd> from the <kbd>gridflow</kbd> directory. Make sure it detects all the components
	you want to use with GridFlow. In MacOS you would normally use FINK to install those extra components: <kbd>ruby libjpeg libjpeg-shlibs libpng-shlibs libpng3 libpng3-shlibs libmpeg libmpeg-shlibs</kbd> 

	In Debian (lenny) or Ubuntu (8.04), do <kbd><pre>
		apt-get install libjpeg62-dev libpng12-dev libmpeg3-dev libquicktime-dev fftw3-dev \
				libaa1-dev libsdl1.2-dev libnetpbm10-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev g++ \
				ruby nasm libglib1.2-dev
		</pre></kbd>
	At least with Ubuntu you can add those, but haven't tried with Debian yet:<kbd><pre>
		apt-get install libcv-dev libdc1394-13-dev
	</pre></kbd>

	Note: you may have to set <kbd>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</kbd> and <kbd>C_INCLUDE_PATH</kbd>
to indicate where to find *.h files, and you 
may have to set both <kbd>LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> and <kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> to indicate where to find 
*.so or *.a or *.dylib or *.bundle or *.dll or *.lib files.
	Note: you can do <kbd>./configure --help</kbd> to get a list of supported 
options. You can use them to ignore the presence of troublesome libraries 
and select debugging level. With <kbd>--use-compiler</kbd> you should use a version of <kbd>g++</kbd>, not 
directly a version of <kbd>gcc</kbd>, else you get <kbd>undefined symbol</kbd> problems. Some versions of gcc/g++ 
are troublesome.
	Run <kbd>make</kbd> to produce the executables <kbd>gridflow.so</kbd> and <kbd>gridflow.pd_linux</kbd> or similar 
	Loading GridFlow:
		PureData : With a text editor, modify or create <kbd>~/.pdrc</kbd> and write <kbd>-lib gridflow</kbd>.  
		DesireData : In "Server Preferences", add <kbd>gridflow</kbd> to the list of libraries. 
Note that on MacOS the dot-files are invisible in the Finder but you do <kbd>cd ~/Desktop; ln -s ../.pdrc "PureData Configuration"</kbd> to make an alias on the Desktop. 
Note also that on Windows the dot-files are even more trouble. </td></tr>

| Other Tips

	you just did a SVN update and now the program does not compile, or 
crashes, or changes didn't go through. 
		When some kinds of changes have happened, you may have to rerun the <kbd>configure</kbd> 
	program before redoing <kbd>make</kbd>. If you had previously reconfigured with specific options, 
	don't forget to use them again in this case.
		Maybe matju forgot to upload part of an important change. Tell him. 
	PureData Crashing: 
		run start Pd from within the debugger using <kbd>gdb $(which pd)</kbd> then <kbd>run</kbd> then cause the crash.
		In GDB, after a crash, you can use the <kbd>where</kbd> to find out what Pd was doing at the moment 
			of the crash. If instead Pd is frozen, you can force it to crash using Ctrl+C in the terminal.
		To quit GDB use the <kbd>quit</kbd> command.  </td></tr>

  ./abstractions ..... Pd object classes written in Pd
  ./src ............. object classes written in C++
  ./bin .............. programs startable as applications
  ./bundled .......... files from other packages, bundled here for convenience
  ./examples ......... more complex Pd programs showing off more practical uses.
  ./doc .............. complete documentation in HTML, with XML source
  ./doc/flow_classes . help files (.pd)
  ./doc/tutorials .... tutorials
  ./examples ......... more complex Pd programs showing off more practical uses.
                       (this will replace ./pd_examples in the future).
  ./images ........... sample images used by ./examples, ./doc
  ./tests ............ will contain Pd programs that test GridFlow itself.
