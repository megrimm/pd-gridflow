 * more samples: Fire, Ripple, Game of Life, Chroma Key, Convolve, Saturation
 * much improved samples: Color Correction, Linear Transform.
 * use [@store uint8] for low-ram storage of values 0-255.
 * videodev: added option norm 0=pal 1=ntsc 2=secam 3=auto

version 0.2.2 (2001.08.15):

 * @video_out auto-updates on X11 ExposeEvent
 * updated documentation and help
 * fixed installation/config of help and summary
 * split BitPacking module from @video_out
 * added support for BTTV input (that is, using mmap() command)
 * new videodev options: channel,tuner,contrast,hue,etc.
 * now with 30 binary operators, and 3 unary operators
 * added many new samples
 * new objects:
	@!, @fold, @outer, @dim, @redim,
	@posterize, @contrast, @two, @three,
	@identity_transform, @scale_to, @spread

version 0.2.1 (2001.08.01):

 * added private CVS repository on hostname.2y.net
 * added configuration script (detects video4linux 1.x)
 * added documentation in HTML format
 * added File Format API
	* format "ppm": PPM P6 RGB24 support read-write
	* format "targa": Targa RGB24 support read-only
	* format "videodev": Video4linux read (using read() command only)
 * @store no longer slowing down its downstream
 * many other accelerations
 * Tuple changed to Dim; Index removed
 * Grid element type is typedef Number
 * @ supports grids in right inlet
 * now there are 20 binary operators

version 0.2.0 (2001.05.05):

 * package name changed from "video" to "video4jmax"
 * new kind of post() cancels repetitive log entries
 * major modifications to existing objects
 * new "grid transmission system"
	(Tuple,Index,GridInlet,GridOutlet,GridObject)
 * vout -> @video_out
 * vin_file -> @video_in_file
 * vout_file -> @video_out_file
 * added @import, @export
 * added @, @store

version 0.1.1 (2001.04.03):

 * removed vout's grab
 * vout width and height parameters swapped
 * vout_file class is mostly like vout but writes to a file in PPM format.

version 0.1.0 (2001.03.14):

 * fixed the bits_per_pixel bug
 * merged in some other variations on the main sample
 * included Christian's makefiles for jmax 2.5

version 0.0.7 (2001.03.08):

 * vout should support most types of RGB visuals now
 * autodraw now works: 0=none; 1=page; 2=line; 3=pixel
 * less global variables
 * putting all of this under the GPL

version 0.0.5 (2001.03.05):

 * vout class, two params: width, height; 24-bit BGR only; refresh by
finishing scanline or sending bang; "grab" (hack); "reset" for resetting
the pixel pointer.



a very short history of GridFlow:

video4jmax 0.1 (mar 2001): sending int messages to a window in jMax
video4jmax 0.2 (may 2001): grids
GridFlow   0.4 (nov 2001): xml manual; can compile without jMax
GridFlow   0.5 (jun 2002): mpeg; cvs goes to artengine.ca
GridFlow   0.6 (aug 2002): ruby; c++; literals
GridFlow   0.6.2 - 0.6.5 : pd; jpeg; big speedups; 1 grid = 1 message
GridFlow   0.7.0 (feb 2003): number types; mmx; other big speedups
GridFlow   0.7.2 - 0.7.5 : pd support gets stable; float grids; @draw_image; source_filter.rb
GridFlow   0.7.6 to 7 (2004): permanently switching from jmax to pd; #pack, #color, #camera
GridFlow   0.8 (2005): attributes; # prefix
GridFlow   0.8.1 to 4 (2006): LTI; FFT; complex numbers; GEM pix compatibility
GridFlow   0.9.0 (2008): removing Ruby, removing LTI, adding OpenCV
GridFlow   2.0 : ...
