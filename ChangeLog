/* $Id$ */

version 0.3.1 (head):
 * added (timewise) profiler
 * added @scale_by for quick scaling by integer factors.
 * @identity_transform, @scale_to are much faster.
 * Format API changes again
 * Formats: "connect" merged into "open"; "size" merged into "option".
 * Formats: @video_out merged into @out.
 * added format "grid" for storing any kind of grid to disk.
 * added TCP client socket support (in "grid" format only)

version 0.3.0 (2001.11.04):
 * reworked File Format API
 * grid objects now all accept lists of integers (auto-convert to 1D grid)
 * many accelerations (incl large speedup on chains of binary operations)
 * transformed @video_out (X11) into a "File Format" (really) and:
	* allows multiple displays
	* auto-resizing window
	* can set output as wallpaper
	* can read from the screen (screenshot)
	* @video_out now a backward-compatibility wrapper
 * format videodev now uses double buffer mmap (somewhat faster)
 * @video_in_file, @video_out_file renamed to @in, @out (with aliases)
 * new objects:
	@convolve, @inner, @for
 * more samples: Fire, Ripple, Game of Life, Chroma Key, Convolve, Saturation
 * much improved samples: Color Correction, Linear Transform.
 * use [@store uint8] for low-ram storage of values 0-255.
 * videodev: added option norm 0=pal 1=ntsc 2=secam 3=auto

version 0.2.2 (2001.08.15):
 * @video_out auto-updates on X11 ExposeEvent
 * updated documentation and help
 * fixed installation/config of help and summary
 * split BitPacking module from @video_out
 * added support for BTTV input (that is, using mmap() command)
 * new videodev options: channel,tuner,contrast,hue,etc.
 * now with 30 binary operators, and 3 unary operators
 * added many new samples
 * new objects:
	@!, @fold, @outer, @dim, @redim,
	@posterize, @contrast, @two, @three,
	@identity_transform, @scale_to, @spread

version 0.2.1 (2001.08.01):
 * added private CVS repository on hostname.2y.net
 * added configuration script (detects video4linux 1.x)
 * added documentation in HTML format
 * added File Format API
	* format "ppm": PPM P6 RGB24 support read-write
	* format "targa": Targa RGB24 support read-only
	* format "videodev": Video4linux read (using read() command only)
 * @store no longer slowing down its downstream
 * many other accelerations
 * Tuple changed to Dim; Index removed
 * Grid element type is typedef Number
 * @ supports grids in right inlet
 * now there are 20 binary operators

version 0.2.0 (2001.05.05):
 * package name changed from "video" to "video4jmax"
 * new kind of post() cancels repetitive log entries
 * major modifications to existing objects
 * new "grid transmission system"
	(Tuple,Index,GridInlet,GridOutlet,GridObject)
 * vout -> @video_out
 * vin_file -> @video_in_file
 * vout_file -> @video_out_file
 * added @import, @export
 * added @, @store

version 0.1.1 (2001.04.03):

 * removed vout's grab
 * vout width and height parameters swapped
 * vout_file class is mostly like vout but writes to a file in PPM format.

version 0.1.0 (2001.03.14):

 * fixed the bits_per_pixel bug
 * merged in some other variations on the main sample
 * included Christian's makefiles for jmax 2.5

version 0.0.7 (2001.03.08):

 * vout should support most types of RGB visuals now
 * autodraw now works: 0=none; 1=page; 2=line; 3=pixel
 * less global variables
 * putting all of this under the GPL

version 0.0.5 (2001.03.05):

 * vout class, two params: width, height; 24-bit BGR only; refresh by
finishing scanline or sending bang; "grab" (hack); "reset" for resetting
the pixel pointer.
