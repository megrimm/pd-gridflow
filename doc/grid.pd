#X text 108 30 Grid Literals;
#X text 141 53 In every grid-accepting inlet \, a list may be sent
instead. If it consists only of numbers \, it will be converted to
a one-dimensional grid. Else it may contain a single "#" sign and integers
on both sides of it \, where the ones to the left of it are fed as
arguments to an imaginary [#redim] object and the one to the right
of it are fed through that [#redim]. In every grid-accepting inlet
\, an integer or float may also be sent : it will be converted to a
zero-dimensional grid (a scalar).;
#X text 106 184 Grid Protocol;
#X text 140 200 a grid has an associated number type that defines what
are the possible values for its elements (and how much space it takes).
the default is int32. a single-dimensional grid of 3 elements (a triplet)
is called dim(3). a three-dimensional grid of 240 rows of 320 columns
of triplets is called dim(240 \, 320 \, 3).;
#X text 139 310 There is a sequence in which elements of a Grid are
stored and transmitted. Dimension 0 is called "first" and dimension
N-1 is called "last". They are called so because if you select a position
in the first dimension of a grid \, the selected part is of the same
shape minus the first dimension \; so in dim(240 \, 320 \, 3) if you
select row 51 (or whichever valid row number) \, you get a dim(320
\, 3). if you further select a subpart of that \, you will get a dim(3)
\, and if you select a subpart of that \, you will get a dim() \, which
is a single number without any indexing (0-dimensional grid).;
#X text 142 466 At each such level \, elements are sent/stored in their
numeric order \, and are numbered using natural numbers starting at
0 This ordering usually does not matter \, but sometimes it does. Most
notably \, [#import] \, [#export] and [#redim] care about it. On the
other hand \, order of dimensions usually does matter \; this is what
distinguishes rows from columns and channels \, for example. Most objects
care about the distinction. A grid with only 1 element in a given dimension
is different from one lacking that dimension \; it won't have the same
meaning. You can use this property to your advantage sometimes.;
