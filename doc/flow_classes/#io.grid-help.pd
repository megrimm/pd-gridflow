a long string of base 256 digits (called bytes) \, but different computers
have different conventions for dealing with them:;
#X text 200 323 big: A number will be written starting with the biggest
digit. This is the natural way on the Macintosh \, Sun \, Amiga \,
and so on.;

smallest digit. This is the natural way on the Intel 386/Pentium.;

more natural on this computer. The natural way is slightly faster to
handle. This is the default setting.;
