#X obj 97 539 doc_m o0 method;
#X text 232 539 indicates that the class has a method named \$2 in
inlet \$1.;
#X text 232 622 inlet -1 represents methods that exist in all inlets
at once from a single definition. this occurs normally only when there
is a variable number of inlets.;
#X text 232 670 a grid method is listed three times : each grid method
is accompanied by a float method and a list method. If any local float
method or list method is hiding the default method(s) brought by the
grid method \, you will not notice.;
#X text 232 731 "method -2 anything" represents a method that catches
anything in any inlet at once.;
#X text 232 766 there is currently no way to define a anything in a
single inlet at a time.;
#X text 232 801 other methods in inlet -2 are for internal use ONLY.
they are not directly reachable from pd.;
#X text 232 561 the constructor (aka creator or new-method) and the
destructor (free-method) are not listed. the dsp-method and perform-function
(for ~ objects) are not listed. however \, the loadbang method is listed.
;
#X text 232 836 inlet numbers don't correspond in some rare cases :
when the CLASS_NOINLET option is in use \, GF inlet numbers don't match
Pd inlet numbers \, the left inlet will be numbered 1 instead of 0
\, and inlet 0 will be invisible. GF currently only uses this for [#from~]
\, but may come to use it for [shunt] \, [route2] \, [route3] and some
more.;

#X obj 97 430 doc_m o0 attr;
#X text 232 430 indicates that \$1 is a valid argument to the get-method
\, and that the get-method will output something named like that when
called without arguments.;
#X text 232 478 some attributes are special in some ways that make
them hidden from that list but still supported by 'get'. this co√Øncides
with when 'get' exceptionally appears in the list of methods.;
#X text 232 923 methods of superclasses are not listed. those are rare
in GF. this mostly just means that 'get' is not listed \, because it
is common to all classes. ('help' was also a common method like that
\, but it was removed in 9.11). it can happen that 'get' is listed
\, when the 'get' of a class has any special cases in it.;
