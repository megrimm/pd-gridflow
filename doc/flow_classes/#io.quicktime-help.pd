#X text 194 33 Support for .mov files. This format supports frame-seek
and frame-tell. Uses the HW-QuickTime library aka QuickTime4Linux (libquicktime.so).
There is also a variant on the same library and that project is just
called LibQuickTime. Some versions of those libraries may include support
for different codecs \, and some also may support entirely different
wrapper formats such as AVI. On Macintosh \, Apple QuickTime is used
instead \, but several of the following messages may not be available.
;
#X obj 100 293 doc_m i0 codec;
#X text 195 293 Allowed values are at least: raw \, jpeg \, png \,
mjpa \, yuv2 \, yuv4. Some other values may allowed \, depending on
the version of the library and which codec plugins are installed. Must
be set before the first frame is written. only applies to [#out]. Choosing
a codec is important because codecs influence greatly the speed of
encoding \, the speed of decoding \, the size of the written file \,
and its fidelity to the original content. Note that there exist other
Apple-QuickTime codecs that are not supported by HW-QuickTime.;
#X obj 100 463 doc_m i0 parameter;
#X text 219 461 \$1=symbol \$2=int;
#X text 219 477 Sets special codec-specific settings. For example:
"parameter jpeg_quality 75";
#X obj 100 513 doc_m i0 framerate;
#X text 222 511 \$1=int;
#X text 198 533 Sets the framerate of the file. This is not used by
GridFlow when reading a file \, but other programs usually care.;
#X obj 100 583 doc_m i0 colorspace;
#X text 228 578 Allowed values are rgb \, rgba \, bgr \, bgra \, yuv
\, yuva. Normally you don't need this.;
#X obj 100 623 doc_m i0 size;
#X text 187 624 \$1=height \$2=width;
#X obj 3 755 doc_o 1;
#X obj 3 794 doc_also;
#X text 199 642 Forces a window size when writing. Usually this has
to be used _after_ setting the framerate and codec and _before_ setting
the codec-parameters. (Strange. Sorry.);
#X obj 100 699 doc_m io force_size;
#X text 224 700 \$1=height \$2=width;
#X text 196 717 forces a window size when reading. this is a workaround
for a problem in HW-QuickTime.;
