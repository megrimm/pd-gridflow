      <p>The philosophy for the design of video4jmax is the same that guides jmax 
        itself:<br>
        provide users with the tools to create effects that can be shared through 
        patches<br>
        or templates. </p>
      <p>While their computation is alike, graphics differ from sound by the amount 
        of<br>
        data they involve. The notion of the Grid is central to the handling of 
        that data<br>
        under video4jmax. The Grid stands as shorthand for "an Array in Several<br>
        Dimensions". </p>
      <p>A picture is a Grid. It has three dimensions: Rows or widths (#0), Columns 
        or<br>
        height (#1), and Channels (#2). Pictures come in all sorts of widths and 
        heights.<br>
        The Channels, however, are more limited in number. Usually it's three: 
        Red,<br>
        Green, Blue. This is the model normally used. </p>
      <p>Grids support other formats than pictures. Like a Grid in which two "channels"<br>
        are actually (x,y) positions in another Grid. Other Grids could be designed 
        to<br>
        represent various things, for example, the patterns for different kinds 
        of blur<br>
        effects. Grids can also exist in several ways: they are usually streamed 
        from<br>
        object to object, but they can also be stored in memory. </p>
      <p>The goal of using Grids is to ensure that people who know the math can 
        build<br>
        reasonably efficient graphical effects without being C programmers. They 
        can<br>
        hopefully be useful for non-graphical effects. </p>
