#X text 35 31 INTRODUCTION;
#X text 63 61 The philosophy that guides PureData is a simple but powerful
one : the software must first provide the user with generic flexible
tools rather than with readymade specialised components that embody
a certain Ã¦sthetic.;
#X text 62 121 In other words the user should have total freedom and
total responsibility. The software is there to provide a mechanism
\, and not a policy. Thus it is a more appropriate tool for the DIY
(Do-It-Yourself) ethic than much other audiovisual software usually
is.;
#X text 62 196 The core of GridFlow closely follows that principle
: although it was made as a video tool \, it first defines a manner
of managing information in general \, and a large set of mathematical
operations \, and only after that \, it uses these things in order
to implement an image-processing a video-processing tool.;
#X text 61 281 By avoiding the use of global variables and rather closely
mimicking the flow of PureData atoms \, GridFlow is closer to PureData's
nature than GEM is.;
