Community
[ ] put new examples on website

Distribution
[ ] should now plan which features are pre-1.0 and which are post-1.0
[ ] review all documentation
[ ] review all examples
[ ] make CDs

Installation
[ ] installable doc
[ ] installable includes ?
[ ] produce linux binaries ("static")
[ ] produce cygwin32 binaries
[ ] produce macosx binaries
[ ] produce linux rpm/deb
[ ] less compile-time checks and more run-time checks
[ ] should GridFlow be bundled with some of its own dependencies?
[ ] reintroduce --puredata-dist-dir ?
[ ] --prefix (pour ruby)
[ ] install vs site-install mess
[ ] --whole-archive
[ ] bridge should check that the gridflow.so file matches.
[ ] make ./configure's 'test' method work using exceptions
    for meaningful error reporting in config.log.
[ ] -falign ...

Documentation
[ ] make a short feature list as a promo
[ ] add credits
[ ] indiquer comment faire un rapport à propos d'une carte v4l ou d'un
    mode x11 non-supporté
[ ] project_policy.xml
[ ] specify policy for <help>, <icon>, etc.
[ ] things you type verbatim are all in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are all in I blocks
[ ] document our own release procedures, how our CVS works
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] document our distribution of the archives
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] document internals
[ ] describe indexmap in doc
[ ] document backward compatibility issues
[ ] typical uses: <typical></typical>
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] it should be indicated whether an object is supported by jmax/pd/ruby/c++
[ ] heavily hyperlink documentation
[ ] automate more parts of the documentation
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
--- remember to keep doc/help/screenshots/examples up to date

Architecture
[ ] eliminate the Dim class, replacing by Grid itself.
[ ] add \ruby \end blocks (multiline inlined rubyscripts)
[ ] attributes
[ ] inlet-variables (variables associated to inlets)
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; etc... (?!?)
[ ] pull mode (functional-style)
[ ] bidirectional messages (constraint/relational-style)
[ ] send-reply messages (imperative-style)
[ ] add reflection (@global#classes, @global#methods, ...)
[ ] GFBridge object visible from Ruby
[ ] use C++ destructor for C++ fields...
[ ] jMax/PD bridges should support list-literals inside messages
[ ] use MétaRuby typing to make things friendlier.
[ ] transmitting grids by diffs?
[ ] dispatch on _n_-prefixed methods (one selector any inlet)
	and     _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[ ] security modes:
	<=0 : can run arbitrary programs and ruby scripts ?
	<=1 : can write files
	<=2 : can read files
	<=3 : can open windows ?
[ ] generalize the backstore
[ ] Outlet#buffer should harmonise with the lcm of its
	corresponding Inlet#factor's.
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator Pt<T> makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[ ] accounting: grids messages packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] memory profiling
[ ] compare Ruby API with both flext/pyext
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects?
    (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a GridFlow::LaterException or something
    (which tells to retry later with the same packet because another
    grid reception is not completed yet.) 
[ ] add a deprecation system
[ ] is "pluglet" a good common word for inlet and outlet? (or "port")
[ ] interpret nested lists as n-dimensional.

Operators
[ ] User-defined operators; compound operators... e.g.
	[@ {{* 7} + {>> 3}}]
[ ] DEF_OP2_BITWISE
[ ] n-ary operators... make [@] a metaclass
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *>> *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] op2: abs- (absolute difference), avg (average)
[ ] remove fold/scan for ops for which it makes no sense.
[ ] MMX memcpy() ?
[ ] MMX _runtime_ autodetection
[ ] erf

Bridge
[ ] jMax metaclasses -> Ruby runtime subclass creation
[ ] UnknownAtom class

Computation Objects
[ ] @counter (similar to @for)
[ ] @inner inlet 2 -> 1, and other incompatibilities i wanted to introduce
[ ] @for "step" argument should have default {1...}
[ ] zero option in @convolve (?)
[ ] @convolve2 (simpler)
[ ] @convolve rewritten as combination of @convolve, @border
[ ] @convolve(2): should allow n-D convolution
[ ] @convolve: compute execution plan for acceleration
    (for duplicate matrix values)
[ ] @convolve: optimise out computations where rhand is neutral (eg: * 1)
[ ] @convolve: optimise out computations rhand is absorbent (eg: * 0)

how about creating aliases like "open window" = "open x11 here" (or arbitrary
user-defined sequence of messages settable in ~/.gridflow_startup)  and "open
videodev" -> "open videodev /dev/video0, option channel 1, option size 240 320" 
maybe there should be a separate ~/.gridflow_config that would be saveable from
gridflow, and ~/.gridflow_startup would be edited only by the user but
~/.gridflow_config would still be a text file.  i say that
because the startup is a ruby script so gridflow couldn't just do
search-and-replace in there, because the option could be inside a "if"
expression and such... at most, gridflow could _append_ text to
.gridflow_startup, to be non-intrusive... hrm... i'm late. i should go now. 

Feature Requests

From: Dave Bergevin <dabergevin@eisa.com> 
  [ ] synchronized audio with the video when using mpeg1 & 2
  [ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)

From: Alexandre Castonguay <acastonguay@artengine.ca>
  [ ] support for tcp/ip connections to control jmax objects (from a web 
      interface)
  [ ] server side jmax to handle multiple incoming commands, audio + video 
      streams
  [ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams

<matju> alx_away:
 je viens d'avoir une idée géniale
 tab completion dans jMax
 hum
 bah c'était juste génial pcq j'avais pas pensé aux problèmes logistiques.
ça marcherait pour les object boxes mais pas pour le reste
 le tab completion ne donnerait pas seulement les noms possibles pour le
prochain argument dans le objectbox; il donnerait aussi une description de
l'argument (surtout dans le cas où l'argument a beaucoup de valeurs
possibles) 
 je pense que le help de jMax est une bonne idée (le concept hands-on)
mais ça pourrait aller plus loin. 
 j'ai pensé intégrer le manuel de référence de gridflow directement dans
le programme, disponible au runtime, dans l'éventualité d'un GUI qui
saurait en tirer avantage. sinon on pourrait faire des hacks cool genre un
message "help" au inlet 0 enverrait une description de la classe dans le log.
 (sauf que dans ce cas: [rubyprint] est tenu d'afficher directement tout
ce qu'il reçoit. alors doit-il écrire "help" ou écrire le help ? 

alx1->matju: détection de plusieurs personnes; détection avec deux caméras
(?);  détecter les formes; détecter les couleurs; support mpeg4; hotspots

<alx1> matju: another feature for the summer : select file to load via a
navigable menu as in 'file/open'
<matju> alx1: this is not a feature i can put in gridflow. if you want it,
then i can make one for pd or jmax or both, but it does not make sense to
add it to gridflow itself.
