[ ] vecops !!!
[ ] SWIG: try -fcompact -fvirtual
[ ] #inner is really slow, and doesnt support seeds of size>1, and isn't vecop-compatible, and ...
ClaudiusMaximus matju: [#draw_image] inlet 0 method "op <opname>" is undocumented, but very useful :)
ClaudiusMaximus matju: [unix_time] is maldocumented, outlet 0 is a grid Dim[28](uint8), not a symbol

[ ] pd_examples -> examples
[ ] update doc
[ ] make good use of the R type (automatic Ruby/C++ convs)
[ ] ditch xml, switch to docstrings or whatever

malloc alignment = 4 mod 8 (en utilisant valgrind)

ClaudiusMaximus matju: feature request:  [#store4], behaves like store but accepts grids 
of floats as coordinates and interpolate using 4-point interpolation, eg, right inlet -> 
(3 3 f # 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 4 8), left inlet -> (1 # 0.5) outputs (0.5 0.5 0.5) 
(or whatever the interpolation would really be), left inlet (2 # 1.5 1.5) outputs (3)

<ClaudiusMaximus> hmm, sending a [reassign( message to the right inlet of a [#store] segfaults Pd
<ClaudiusMaximus> hmmm, i get a segfault with a simple patch sending "reassign, put_at (0 0), reassign" to the right inlet of [#store (3 3 # 0)]
<alx1> back to the [display] object, it lingers for a moment after deletion
<alx1> and returns a 'pd_activate' error after I move it
<alx1> matju: once I delete it, unlike the other gui objects, it takes about one second before it dissapears, maybe a difference in tcl versions?

--- make the development process more test-driven:
    * file every feature request and bug report into base/test.rb so
      that gridflow fails those tests;
    * THEN make gridflow pass those tests.

===================

Distribution
[ ] should now plan which features are pre-1.0 and which are post-1.0
[ ] review all documentation
[ ] review all examples
[ ] make CDs

Installation
[ ] produce linux binaries ("static")
[ ] produce cygwin32 or mingw32 binaries
[ ] produce macosx binaries
[ ] produce linux rpm/deb
[ ] less compile-time checks and more run-time checks
[ ] should GridFlow be bundled with some of its own dependencies?
[ ] find a good profiler (not gridflow's internal...)
[ ] cross-compile:
	http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/
	http://rooster.stanford.edu/~ben/linux/cross.php

Documentation
[ ] make a short feature list as a promo
[ ] add credits
[ ] indiquer comment faire un rapport à propos d'une carte v4l ou d'un mode x11 non-supporté
[ ] project_policy.xml
[ ] specify policy for <help>, <icon>, etc.
[ ] things you type verbatim are all in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are all in I blocks
[ ] document our own release procedures, how our CVS works
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] document our distribution of the archives
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] document internals
[ ] describe indexmap in doc
[ ] document backward compatibility issues
[ ] typical uses: <typical></typical>
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] it should be indicated whether an object is supported by pd/ruby/c++
[ ] heavily hyperlink documentation
[ ] automate more parts of the documentation
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
[ ] mimic [pdp_help_input] [pdp_help_output]: they are convenient
--- remember to keep doc/help/screenshots/examples up to date
[ ] <jtm_> the suggestion would be to add a link at the end of each section leading to the next section

Source Filter
[ ] add \ruby \end blocks (multiline inlined rubyscripts)
[ ] \attr

Architecture
[0.8] reentrancy of objects (to allow true recursion)
[0.8] inlet-attrs (attrs associated to inlets)
[ ] eliminate the Dim class, replacing by Grid itself (?).
[ ] pull mode (functional-style)
[ ] bidirectional messages (constraint/relational-style)
[ ] send-reply messages (imperative-style)
[ ] add reflection (#global:classes, #global:methods, ...)
[ ] use MétaRuby typing to make things friendlier.
[ ] transmitting grids by diffs?
[0.8] dispatch on _n_-prefixed methods (one selector any inlet)
	  and     _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[0.8] generalize the backstore
[ ] Outlet#buffer should harmonise with the lcm of its corresponding Inlet#factor's.
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator T* makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[0.8] accounting: grids messages packets numbers bytes copybytes
[0.8] memory profiling
[0.8] compare Ruby API with both flext/pyext
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects?
    (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a GridFlow::LaterException or something
    (which tells to retry later with the same packet because another
    grid reception is not completed yet.) 
[ ] interpret nested lists as n-dimensional.
[0.8] MMX memcpy() ?
[0.8] MMX _runtime_ autodetection

Operators
[ ] User-defined operators; compound operators... e.g. [# {{* 7} + {>> 3}}]
[ ] [#] won't have n-ary operators... should they exist?
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *>> *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&

Computation Objects
[ ] #counter (similar to #for)
[ ] #for "step" argument should have default {1...}
[ ] zero option in #convolve (?)
[ ] #conv (simpler #convolve) should allow n-D convolution
[ ] #convolve rewritten as combination of #conv+#border ?
[ ] @complex_sq is backwards
[ ] #store: option zero (?)
[ ] #import~, #export~
[ ] #fold, #scan: option reverse (right-to-left)
[ ] #join: option swap
[ ] #matrix_inverse, #matrix_solve
[ ] #timeline (or rtmetro): sequencing of events from grid
[ ] #replace_if, #random_select, #markov_chain, #sort, #slice, #splice
[ ] #polygon_perimeter, #polygon_area, #draw_polygon smoothly
[ ] fuzzy #store (interpolate)
[ ] write a complete benchmark script
[ ] spatial biquads (ask Tom)
[ ] string operations to compensate for the feebleness of PD in that area.
	this includes [#sprintf].
--- see also APL/J/NArray/PDL/Aplus/Yorick/IPOW reference

Effects
[ ] #mosaic
[ ] #gaussian_blur, #sobel, #pixelize, #despeckle (median)
[ ] #dither, #draw_lines, #draw_points, #fire, #queue
[ ] #chroma_key: i0=RGBpicture i1=RGBcolor i2=tolerance o0=RGBApicture
        with fuzzy flag; (don't call it #chroma_key though)
	maybe #mask...
[ ] turtle (logo style)
[ ] effectv
[ ] create abstractions for usage patterns (eg: like #remap_image)
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] kaleidoscopes
[ ] bilinear interpolation a+(b-a)*x+(c-a)*y+(a-b-c+d)*x*y (#scale_by smoothly?)
[ ] #scale_by/#downscale_by fractional values
[ ] bicubic interpolation
[ ] multilinear interpolation (n-dimensional?)
[ ] #daltonism
[ ] #perlin ?
[ ] #centroid should have an arg (int n=2) for number of dimensions (and so number of outlets minus one?)

Input/Output
[ ] replace "open <driver> <source> <filename>" by "open <driver> <mrl>"
[ ] videodev: is it possible to reach 60 fps ?
[ ] a #store that is persistent (saved in .pd) ?
[ ] Grid: support storage in all six types
[ ] Grid: bpv 1,2,4 uint
[ ] Grid: text version of the format
[ ] Gimp, GStreamer, ffmpeg, xine, mplayer, PDP, OSC
[ ] RubyX11 0.6
[ ] support for output inside of a GUI app (Tk/Gtk/Qt/...)
[ ] get subtitling of tv channels
[ ] add messages "load", "save" as open,bang,close combos. (?)
[ ] use 1.8.0's IO#read(Integer,String)->String
[ ] SDL: should support multiple windows
[ ] x11,sdl,aalib: use buffering to synchronise frames at a constant rate.
[ ] x11: sync with the actual vsync of the monitor
[ ] x11: maybe vram-to-vram copy using X11's Pixmap remote-objects
[ ] shell object?
[ ] #import, 'grid tcp': option: sudden vs gradual transmission through gridflow.
[ ] HPGL, [unixtime]
[ ] [parallel_port], [serial_port], [usb_mouse]

Format
[ ] remaining number type support in formats
[ ] all: possibly get rid of the "format" notion ?
[ ] PNM: P1,P2,P3,P4,P5 support
[ ] XBM, XPM, GIF support
[ ] fork: pseudoformat for launching format handler as separate process
[ ] put_at/reassign in x11/sdl/quartz
[ ] /dev/dsp, /dev/mixer
[ ] Generic SHM/MMAP Drivers
[ ] "open grid pipe" and such.
[ ] TCP: non-blocking write
[ ] TCP: buffer n grids
[ ] multi: multi-file (by glob pattern, e.g.: foo*.ppm)
[ ] AVI
[ ] format grid: "headerless until 10" (text files)

User Interface
[ ] color picker
[ ] gridbox (akin to intbox) or grid edition dialog, etc.
[ ] peephole:
    [ ] works without x11 (for osx...)
    [ ] does it really work with something other than 3 channels ?
    [ ] add a popup menu that makes sense
[ ] make ruby/tcl evaluator boxes retractable
[ ] vector slider (n parallel sliders in one, Dim(n))
[ ] 2d slider
[ ] radial slider (angle chooser)
[ ] drag-and-drop palette of object construction
[ ] object construction menu specialized for each class
	(generated from class reflection/metadata)

Extra/Examples/Etc
[ ] .pd: read; write better
[ ] examples/generique.pd
[ ] add examples from the workshop, etc

how about creating aliases like "open window" = "open x11 here" (or arbitrary
user-defined sequence of messages settable in ~/.gridflow_startup)  and "open
videodev" -> "open videodev /dev/video0, option channel 1, option size 240 320" 
maybe there should be a separate ~/.gridflow_config that would be saveable from
gridflow, and ~/.gridflow_startup would be edited only by the user but
~/.gridflow_config would still be a text file.  i say that
because the startup is a ruby script so gridflow couldn't just do
search-and-replace in there, because the option could be inside a "if"
expression and such... at most, gridflow could _append_ text to
.gridflow_startup, to be non-intrusive...

Feature Requests

From: Dave Bergevin <dabergevin@eisa.com> 
  [ ] synchronized audio with the video when using mpeg1 & 2
  [ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)
From: Alexandre Castonguay <acastonguay@artengine.ca>
  [ ] server side pd to handle multiple incoming commands, audio + video streams
  [ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams

<matju> alx:
 le tab completion ne donnerait pas seulement les noms possibles pour le
prochain argument dans le objectbox; il donnerait aussi une description de
l'argument (surtout dans le cas où l'argument a beaucoup de valeurs
possibles) 
 je pense que le help de Pd est une bonne idée (le concept hands-on)
mais ça pourrait aller plus loin. 
 j'ai pensé intégrer le manuel de référence de gridflow directement dans
le programme, disponible au runtime, dans l'éventualité d'un GUI qui
saurait en tirer avantage. (sauf que dans ce cas: [rubyprint] est tenu
d'afficher directement tout ce qu'il reçoit. alors doit-il écrire "help" ou écrire le help ? 

alx1->matju: détection de plusieurs personnes; détection avec deux caméras
(?);  détecter les formes; détecter les couleurs; support mpeg4; hotspots

> http://redshift.sourceforge.net/debugging-GC/ [ruby-talk:53835]
> You might also want to search the web for "malloc debugger".

<ircbridge> <GPS> Tcl_GetObjResult Tcl_GetErrorInfo ...
<ircbridge> <GPS> Tcl_GetStringResult may also be helpful.  (note I can't
seem to find Tcl_GetErrorInfo (maybe I dreamed it up)) 
<ircbridge> <GPS> matju: BTW CatchObjCmd might help too
<ircbridge> <GPS> I see that the new Tcl_Dict commands have taken over the HEAD's CatchObjCmd

ClaudiusMaximus reports that allocating a 197M grid causes a crash (turns out C++
throws exception, can't allocate, signal ABRT)

ClaudiusMaximus says: I want to be able to send output from Pd+Gridflow to a video4linux
loopback device so that other v4l programs can access the stream.
I found the video loopback device here: http://motion.sourceforge.net/vloopback/

<alx2>
iSight on linux : http://episteme.arstechnica.com/6/ubb.x?a=tpc&s=50009562&f=8300945231&m=40110681
needs something called 'coriander'. the person who got it working mentions libdc1394.
http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/PEOPLE/DOUXCHAMPS/ieee1394/cameras/index.html:
I learn that the iSight is compliant with version 1.30 of IIDC.
the docs for coriander mention that the author needed to create a major and minor device for the camera.
retyping (damn pdf's) -> there are two devices to create: raw1394 and video1394
raw1394 has major 171 and minor 0 while video1394 had major 171 and minor 16
any useful info?
having a camera like the iSight supported could be fantastic for video capture/detection on a laptop.  Not to mention that the bttv cards are getting harder to locate

-mfpmath=sse2

<MiS> <matju> alx2: btw you cannot set helpfiles explicitly on _abstractions_... 
<MiS> yes you can
<MiS> and specify -helppath to add a path to help.  So selecting 'Help'
      in the pop-up on an abstraction will open a help fiel for that abstraction

"Bangs in a geiger counter have a l*dt probability of occuring
 in a dt time interval. Therefore the time till the next event
 follows a Exp(l) law, for which:
 f(t) = l*exp(-l*t)
 F(t) = integral of l*exp(-l*t)*dt = 1-exp(-l*t)
 F^-1(p) = -log(1-p)/l
 //return (uint64)(1000LL*ms*-log(1-drand()));"
