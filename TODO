[9.14] GridFlow Index crashes @ CIM
[9.14] make sure docs are up-to-date
[9.14] Stack size problem : GridFlow shouldn't allocate any big stuff on stack.Attr

[ ] list-attrs
[ ] multi-valued attributes in source_filter
[ ] fix grid attribute setters
[ ] [shunt] [route2] [route3] should have their attr-inlet on the right (maybe) or hidden (CLASS_NOINLET) (maybe)
[ ] on which classes do we add an attr-outlet ?
[ ] doc attributes: [doc_a] [doc_aa] ?
[ ] support "get" in abstractions... automatically, through [args] ? or [attr] ?
[ ] movie api : merge "height" & "width" attributes as "size" to be like the cam api
[ ] int64, float64 should be rejected from NumberTypeE \attr and arguments when in --lite mode
[ ] add ro attr support
[ ] [#in] [#out]: autoclose is currently not considered as an attribute.
[ ] [#out x11]: add 'rootsize' ro attr
[ ] [gf/class_info]: add class-list, attr types, arg types, superclasses

Args

[ ] [args] loadbang order really, really sucks.
[ ] is outlet_anything2 and pd_anything2 really something we want as a behaviour of [args] ???
[ ] can't handle [args] that come out as grid literals and have to become setter messages.
[ ] use [args] everywhere it should be used: e.g. [#background_model] but also many more
[ ] on n'a pas un vrai [getargs] au niveau du binbuf (ce qui, en soi, n'est pas évident)
    et ça va être compliqué d'éditer les args pour y rajouter vraiment ce qu'on veut.
    (qu'est-ce qu'on fait avec les virgules ?)
[ ] unparse_args, pass_args could be doing more common work, and use a.join(",").
[ ] [args] -noparens, -nocomma

./configure and make and related

[ ] --use-cpu not even used while detecting ?
[ ] gridflow_gem*.pd_linux : missing error message on load (sometimes) because of sys_load_lib
[ ] -lpng12 OSX (commit it)
[ ] example from claude :

GEM/PDP

[9.14] [#from_pix]: yuv in support, yuv out support
[ ] [#from_pix, colorspace y] may have different contrast/brightness because of differences between the two definitions of Y
[ ] when [#from_pix] uses [pix_rgba] or [pix_grey], there is one empty frame of size (0 0 4) instead of the 1st frame. why ?
[ ] [#to_pix] newimage=0 to save CPU time and/or bus time?
[9.14] reverify gem.cxx on OSX Intel-vs-PPC. Did I see a problem with 3 channels again ?
[ ] a way to make GEM/PDP/GF conversions *implicitly* instead of having objects for that (?)

#expr

[ ] [#expr] local
[9.14] more [#expr] : int rint imodf modf drem fmod size sum Sum

[ ] [#see] shm : http://wiki.tcl.tk/2999
[ ] [display] [print]: distinguer les () de symboles vs les () de A_LIST ?
[ ] [#see] invalid command name when sending image in hidden subpatch or abs.
[ ] matju->oli :
    mais il y a quand même le problème qu'à l'affichage, on est censés voir   
    «...» quand la suite des valeurs est pas montrée. c'est pas documenté
    comme tel, mais on s'y attend parce que ça arrive la plupart du temps,    
    mais je sais pas pourquoi des fois ça marche pas.

Docs

[ ] reform GFDP so that interactions with pd43 and l2ork become debuggable.
[ ] document "f 1 2 3" as a shortcut grid literal
[ ] reduce the amount of sys_gui() to be done by GFDP while idle.

[ ] [#import] does the same rounding bullshit again, when we want a float grid
[ ] figure out way to share resources like [#text_to_image] and [#in qbert.png] and such, in qbert.pd and others
[ ] should clean the -path thing because /abstractions/ gets saved in the path
[ ] think about A_LIST, the 'binbuf' selector, the 'list' selector, and the auto-unfolding of list atoms into list messages.
[9.14] terrible bug in [#store] put_at with feedback and/or grid too big. can crash.
[ ] accelerate [#outer ignore (0)]
[ ] other invalid command name ".x8f03820.c" not related to hidden [display]
[ ] test negative dimension sizes in grid-literals, [#import], [#pack], [#redim], etc
[ ] alias numops so that they are more pd-like
[ ] make a rounding [# *>>8] ?
[ ] [#import] bug (see atelier)
[ ] remove RAISE from grid.cxx, because of all the problems it causes.
    generally, be a lot more careful about exception handling, because
    assuming an operation works, is as troublesome when using throw/catch as when you don't,
    because if you assume an operation works, you're not really _using_ throw/catch.
[ ] isn't .str().data() evil ?
[ ] turtle.pd
[ ] [#remap_image, cache]. also, if the left-grid of [#store] could be cached in such a case, it could be very much faster.
[ ] [#import (...) f] converts floats to int to float (wtf)
[ ] [#out x11]: picture too big will be rejected by x11-shm and perhaps crash or leak shm (easy to do in #scale_by-help.pd)
[ ] merge simple_mask.pd, color_detect.pd
[ ] [#in]/[#out]: what happened to frame number in right outlet?
[ ] [doc_cc] [doc_ii] [doc_oo] where $1 is a symbol don't reposition themselves properly.
[ ] put_at is lacking some checks for number-of-dims, causing segfault.
[ ] strange problem with [#import] when input size doesn't match output size and object is recreated
[ ] conversion from float to int is inconsistent: when to round and when to trunc?
[ ] what to do with [#motion_detection] ?
[ ] [#swap]: convertir un littéral de grille en grille avant de la passer à l'outlet de droite
[ ] [pack] trigger_by (choose which inlets are hot)
[ ] remove last outlet of [#] when it's irrelevant, and don't have a $2 in that case.
[ ] set_mode(6) was removed on 2008.07.11 and never compensated for. what do we do now?
[ ] error: [#io.quicktime in gf_spirals_and_moire.avi]: unknown colorspace 'yuv' (supported: rgb, rgba, bgr, bgrn, yuv, yuva)
[ ] regularise Grid[a,b] vs Grid Dim[a,b] vs Dim[a,b] vs a grid of size (a,b) or (a b)... big mess
[ ] distinguish messages vs atoms in this manual
    e.g. [doc_aa] would contain something like [doc_m] but wouldn't have [doc_m] as a subnode.
[ ] [gf/canvas_loadbang]: is it buggy? (see [doc_h] double-bang problem)
[ ] [fps]: translate into pd: "publish if fps>0.001" (to remove outliers)
[ ] #inner doesnt support seeds of size>1, and isn't vecop-compatible, and ...
[ ] #inner could optimise permutation matrices?

[ ] retune [#rgb_to_yuv] and [#yuv_to_rgb] and [#greyscale...] etc.
[ ] make single abstraction that replaces all picture converters and more.
[ ] various_effects.pd doesn't completely support greyscale. other patches don't necessarily, either.
    make more efforts to make colorspaces switchable.
[ ] [display] visible outside redrectangle in [doc_h]
[ ] [doc_o] has a bit of a sync problem when creating [doc_oo] (sometimes?)
    this is a [doc_make] bug because not using [gf/canvas_loadbang].
[ ] visfn: if (self->vis & !flag) sys_vgui(".x%lx.c delete %s\n",long(c),self->rsym->s_name);
[ ] add default values in docs (at the framework level)
[ ] introduce automatic type conversion (en utilisant sand.pd comme exemple)
[ ] [#saturation] is a linear colorspace transform: therefore it could be accelerated just like [#hueshift] could.
[ ] reduce [doc_h] clock again before release !
[ ] uniformise name of 'color' [doc_accolade] vs 'bgcolor' [#many].
[ ] revoir le système de paquetage pour linux.

[ ] big bug in rendering of [#type-gui, vertical] (leaves trace of horiz [#type-gui] behind) when not loaded directly from file.
[ ] fix [#fastblur] wrong size bug
[ ] change description of GridFlow on gridflow.ca and puredata.info
[ ] commandline version of shoot.pd craps out sometimes, eating all RAM...
[ ] [#out grid]: cast et type...?
[ ] go through all examples again, to see whether everything works.
[ ] [doc_link] doesn't use [doc_iemfont]
[ ] harmonise help files of [#in] [#out] [#io.*] and introduce help files for abstract 'standardised' interfaces such as
    'window', 'movie', 'image', 'camera', talking about common options... (re)move superfluous parts of [#in].
[ ] PtrOutlet() : replace error() by RAISE() if you can
[ ] error: [#store] inlet 0 method float: must have at least 1 dimension. ~GridOut(): dex=0 prod=1
[ ] reintroduce numop1. split number.cxx into numop1.cxx and numop2.cxx. numop1 will be used in both [#] and [#expr].
[*] merge << and pd_oprint please
[ ] near-infinite loop in shoot.pd
[ ] change numop to numop2 all over the documentation
[ ] renommer t_symbol * à symbol ou Symbol, et t_atom2 à atom ou Atom ? (peux pas renommer t_atom2 *)
[ ] #fold and #scan begin without seed but can't send "seed none" to [#fold +]
[*] error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (in has float32\; r has int32)
    pourrait devenir :
    error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (inlet 0 has float32, inlet 1 has int32)
    ou:
    error: [# -] inlet 0 method grid: same type please (left is float32, right is int32)
    (ou autre)
[ ] make this work in the future :
    error: [#for 0 0] inlet 0 method set: can't convert to grid: \\\\a(A_GRIDOUT 0x90ca8e0)
[ ] [lb] ? [m] ? (but Cyrille already uses the name [lb], ...)
[ ] finish adding PD_BLOBS A_BLOB class_addblob support (have to check for vanilla at runtime, etc.)
[ ] think about link between multidimensional [#for] and future [#decode] (or is it [#encode] ?)
[ ] allow direct passing of a grid as an atom of type Grid instead of just GridOut.
[ ] in case of some camera problems, [#camera] says OFF even when it's not closed.
[ ] test accuracy of RGB2Y etc
[ ] [#camera] [#cast] setting ? or not ?
[ ] automated loadtime patch rewriting in order to get rid of deprecated forms (?)
[ ] DimConstraint could become a lot better than just the current CONSTRAINT() thing.
[ ] try to fix value of [tsctime]. divide initial tsc test by a [realtime] result ? or just redefine [tsctime] as giving
    a value in million cycles or something.
[ ] make a generic graph tool that can do efficient graphs using grids (?) and can be configured to do things like PMPD
    but can also serve other purposes. And/or start from waves.pd's mask system to make a patch that recycles the wave data
    to make a CHDH-like animations using [gf/gl].
[ ] see [comment] from cyclone
[ ] Dim::T = intptr_t ?
[ ] DEF_OP(clipunder, a<0?0:a>=b?b-1, 0, false, false)
[ ] DEF_OP(pingpong,  ...)
[ ] custom m_pd.h
[ ] runtime or compiletime check for l2ork (preferably runtime). use it in the customised m_pd.h.
[ ] can't get dllimport/dllexport for windows to work (should look at http://oldwiki.mingw.org/index.php/sample%20DLL )
[ ] malloc alignment = 4 mod 8 (en utilisant valgrind)
[ ] find why libjpeg can't be directly used in postdigital.pd
[ ] numop2 "rol" et "ror"

#many

[ ] add support for non-i grids
    [ ] should the internal grid always stored as float, and then a [#cast] would change it to the user's favourite type ?
[ ] add support for abstraction components
    [ ] abstraction component location lookup doesn't uplevel.
    [ ] [gf/object_bbox] doesn't support looking up a [receives] inside the abstraction because it is 'not patchable'
        and because it's not in the same canvas either
    [ ] [gf/object_bbox] can't look in a separate canvas (and it would be better if it could)
        and I want to use a 2nd order GOP to make things easier (avoid mistakes when saving abstraction)
[ ] spacing and margins don't get saved when properties-dialogue has not been used
[ ] doesn't show little star indicating that file hasn't been saved
[ ] add support for [hsl] and [vsl]
[ ] use [gf/canvas_loadbang]
[ ] examples/minesweeper.pd

Not Urgent
[ ] systematise like is_atom_sel(symbol) is true for float, symbol, pointer, and perhaps blob and grid
    and is_base_sel(symbol) also would include bang and list.
[ ] [#inner] nonscalar seeds ?
[ ] [#scan] could use the same yn==1 optimisation that [#fold] uses
[ ] reenable numop1 isinf finite isnan
[ ] [gf/numop_info]
[ ] algebraïc properties of some numop2s are not written down (0,false,false instead)
[ ] heat.pd still sucks (?)
[ ] cellular_1d.pd: should get a variable width
[ ] [#in unicap] and/or [#in videojack] ?
[ ] [#draw_polygon] : some more weirdnesses in rendering. play a bit with #draw_polygon-test2.pd to see.
[ ] fix warnings in config.log on OSX
[ ] [#find]
[ ] http://claudiusmaximus.goto10.org/cm/2010-12-15_histogram_equalization.html
[ ] canvasdelete
[ ] revive dc1394 module ?
[ ] intégrer -lib segfault ?
[ ] "seedless" should be really skipping over the seed. but this didn't improve speed for [#fold].
    so, I didn't continue the job on [#scan] [#inner] (note that [#inner] already a special case related to that)
[ ] [#draw_polygon, alpha]
[ ] [#draw_polygon] : multi-rule optimisé (a besoin d'une règle de distributivité du type : a+b+b = a+2b)
[ ] do something about [memstat]
[?] rgb_delay5.pd crashes ([#convolve]) apparently only when --use-cpu=pentium3
[ ] Claude L. on OSX 10.5.8 with GF 9.13-test6, [#io.png]: inlet -1 method grid: !png
[*] [gf/error] can't take a list of atoms because it has to go through a fixed-number sprintf. (see [#is])

OpenCV
[ ] cvOpticalFlow
[ ] [cv/#Split]
[ ] cvEstimateRigidTransform
[ ] cvApproxPoly pour un seul poly à la fois
[ ] cvMeanShift, cvCamShift (?)
       cvCamShift s'utilise presque comme MeanShift, sauf que ça requiert un autre type non-grid.
       Celui-ci peut être représenté comme une grille de 5 éléments pour faire plus facile
       (contrairement à cvHistogram, qui contient une grille ND mais a besoin de quelques champs de plus que ça).
[ ] cvCalcBackProject (?)
[ ] cvCalcHist, cvCreateHist.
[ ] SnakeImage
[ ] on doit aussi commencer à rajouter des types non-grid. Le premier sera CvHistogram et est requis pour tous les objets dont le nom contient "Hist".

Other
[ ] OpenCL
[ ] encoding of quicktime RGBA (PNG) does not work at all!
[ ] add concepts of hot inlet and conf inlet at the code level (?)
[ ] Add a video latency patch (in examples)
[ ] check whether we could benefit more from alignment of data (currently not much)
[ ] rearrange FObject,GridInlet,GridOut structures in a different manner ?
[ ] [#line]? [#pipe]?
[ ] rewrite [#rgb_to_rgba] [#rgba_to_rgb] in C++ if I'm not going to rework [#inner] soon enough.
[ ] #,#fold,#scan,...: option swap
[ ] re-test int64,float64 and make sure it works
[ ] small leak remaining in x11? may have to do with non-use of XDestroyImage?
[ ] is [#convolve] actually cross-correlation ? that is, convolves with a mirror image of the convolution matrix.
[9.14] #import with zero size crashes?
[ ] MMX computations may be done misaligned, which may be bad.
[ ] "unsupported codec" bogus errors.
[ ] some seeds aren't typechecked (which ones ?)
[ ] GRID_FINISH triggered while backstore ???
[ ] what would be a way to make GF work well with Pd's idea of a list?
[ ] write unit tests about required functionality
[ ] write unit tests about error checking
[ ] make system to ensure everything is working before a release.
[ ] it's possible to crash by sending data in two inlets of a same object at once

Documentation
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
[ ] mimic [pdp_help_input] and [pdp_help_output] ?

Architecture
[ ] reentrancy of objects (to allow true recursion)
[ ] expand the [doc_same] concept
[ ] dispatch on _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[ ] generalize the backstore
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator T* makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[ ] accounting: grids packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] memory profiling
[ ] add a way to handle missing data so that we don't have to ever use [#t].
[ ] MMX/SSE in C (remove Asm/Ruby code). seems to be damn hard.
[ ] find a good profiler to use with GridFlow; did I look at http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/about/ ?
    what about: qprofile, amd profiler, opreport -cl --demangle=smart
[ ] read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming
[ ] Copy-on-Write (COW)
[ ] internal grid protocol redesigned
[ ] use of lcm() in grid.cxx could be avoided. it's useless.
[ ] look at GSlice (both the one in GLib and http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/valarray/gslice/ )

Computation Objects
[ ] ClaudiusMaximus matju: feature request:  [#store4], behaves like store but accepts grids of floats as coordinates and
    interpolates using 4-point interpolation, eg, right inlet -> (3 3 f # 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 4 8), left inlet -> (1 # 0.5)
    outputs (0.5 0.5 0.5) (or whatever the interpolation would really be), left inlet (2 # 1.5 1.5) outputs (3)
[ ] #counter (similar to #for)
[ ] zero option in #convolve (as an alternative to wraparound)... sort of a built-in #border
[ ] #convolve should allow n-D convolution
[ ] #store: option zero (?)
[ ] #fold, #scan: option reverse (right-to-left) (is this useful ?)
[ ] #join: option swap
[ ] #matrix_solve (CV), #replace_if, #random_select, #markov_chain, #splice, full-featured #slice (in c++)
[ ] add 2D markov example
[ ] #draw_polygon smoothly
[ ] write a complete benchmark
[ ] spatial biquads (ask Tom)
[ ] implement the whole APL feature set :
    expand, laminate, take, drop, indexof, rotate, generalizedtranspose, deal, decode, encode, membership, format, ...
[ ] #mosaic, #dither, #queue (#delay ?)
[ ] #gaussian_blur, #sobel, #pixelize, #despeckle (median)
[ ] #chroma_key: i0=RGBpicture i1=RGBcolor i2=tolerance o0=RGBApicture
        with fuzzy flag; (don't call it #chroma_key though)
	maybe #mask...
[ ] create abstractions for usage patterns (eg: like #remap_image)
[ ] multilinear interpolation a+(b-a)*x+(c-a)*y+(a-b-c+d)*x*y (#scale_by smoothly?)
[ ] #scale_by/#downscale_by fractional values
[ ] bicubic interpolation
[ ] multilinear interpolation (n-dimensional?)
[ ] #perlin
[ ] #moment could support more than 2 dimensions

Input/Output
[ ] [#store]: use #A for storage
[ ] Grid: support storage in all six numtypes and perhaps also bpv 1,2,4.
[ ] x11: double buffering using a Pixmap remote-object, sync frames at constant rate, optionally with the actual vsync of the monitor
[ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams
[ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)
[ ] support for audio in cameras / videodev ... see field vcaps.audios
[ ] lqtgavl
[ ] Tom Schouten wrote: «added demo/rawvideo.pf and some support scripts in bin/pf-rawvideo.*; this is an example on how to
    use external programs for raw video input. rationale: mplayer is a very nice piece of software supporting virtually any
    input format/codec. since i'm not planning to waste time on integrating more input codecs in pf, the best alternative is
    to have mplayer (actually mencoder) or ffmpeg as a subprocess. the same will be done for recording later.»
[ ] [#in v4l2] lacks framerate, tuner, norm, frequency.
[ ] fix SDL modifiers
[ ] colorspace rgba has no effect on [#in violoncelle.mov] (still 3 channels)

Format
[ ] remaining number type support in formats
[ ] threaded [#in]/[#out] handlers
[ ] put_at/reassign in x11/sdl/quartz ?
[ ] Generic SHM/MMAP Drivers
[ ] "open grid pipe" and such.
[ ] format grid: "headerless until 10" (text files)
[ ] is there anything else deserving to be unified between the video plugins?
[ ] look at camorama
[ ] Generic Image Library: http://opensource.adobe.com/gil/html/giltutorial.html

[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] crash when opening busy camera (?) or is it when opening two cameras at once ?
[ ] [#io.quicktimecamera] framerate (parce que QuickTime donne des frames en double quand le métro est trop vite)
    (et parce que sur un ordi que je viens d'essayer, on détermine qu'on a juste 15 fps pcq quand le métro est plus
     vite, la détection de mouvement de various_effects.pd fait un clignotement. est-ce qu'on peut vraiment avoir 30 fps
     présentement ? est-ce que ça dépend de la dernière app qui a ouvert la caméra avant gridflow ? faire des tests avec
     [pix_video] et [#camera] en alternance.)

[ ] [#many]: add support for 'floatatom' objects ?
    (no: we require method 'pos'. apart from that we could work around the lack of 'send', 'receive')
[ ] ps3eye problem (see gridflow-dev 17 mai 2010) (wtf)
[ ] make a clean GridOut::~GridOut. can't make one because ~GridOut often happens after the next GridOut construction.
