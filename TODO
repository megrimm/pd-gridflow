	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; etc... (?!?)
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *>> *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&

	[@ {{* 7} + {>> 3}}]
[ ] n-ary operators... make [@] a metaclass

[ ] accounting: grids messages packets numbers bytes copybytes
[ ] memory profiling
[ ] compare Ruby API with both flext/pyext
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects?
    (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a GridFlow::LaterException or something
    (which tells to retry later with the same packet because another
    grid reception is not completed yet.) 
[ ] add a deprecation system
[ ] is "pluglet" a good common word for inlet and outlet?

how about creating aliases like "open window" = "open x11 here" (or arbitrary
user-defined sequence of messages settable in ~/.gridflow_startup)  and "open
videodev" -> "open videodev /dev/video0, option channel 1, option size 240 320" 
maybe there should be a separate ~/.gridflow_config that would be saveable from
gridflow, and ~/.gridflow_startup would be edited only by the user but
~/.gridflow_config would still be a text file.  i say that
because the startup is a ruby script so gridflow couldn't just do
search-and-replace in there, because the option could be inside a "if"
expression and such... at most, gridflow could _append_ text to
.gridflow_startup, to be non-intrusive... hrm... i'm late. i should go now. 

Feature Requests

From: Dave Bergevin <dabergevin@eisa.com> 
  [ ] synchronized audio with the video when using mpeg1 & 2
  [ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)

From: Alexandre Castonguay <acastonguay@artengine.ca>
  [ ] support for tcp/ip connections to control jmax objects (from a web 
      interface)
  [ ] server side jmax to handle multiple incoming commands, audio + video 
      streams
  [ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams

<matju> alx_away:
 je viens d'avoir une idée géniale
 tab completion dans jMax
 hum
 bah c'était juste génial pcq j'avais pas pensé aux problèmes logistiques.
ça marcherait pour les object boxes mais pas pour le reste
 le tab completion ne donnerait pas seulement les noms possibles pour le
prochain argument dans le objectbox; il donnerait aussi une description de
l'argument (surtout dans le cas où l'argument a beaucoup de valeurs
possibles) 
 je pense que le help de jMax est une bonne idée (le concept hands-on)
mais ça pourrait aller plus loin. 
 j'ai pensé intégrer le manuel de référence de gridflow directement dans
le programme, disponible au runtime, dans l'éventualité d'un GUI qui
saurait en tirer avantage. sinon on pourrait faire des hacks cool genre un
message "help" au inlet 0 enverrait une description de la classe dans le log.
 (sauf que dans ce cas: [rubyprint] est tenu d'afficher directement tout
ce qu'il reçoit. alors doit-il écrire "help" ou écrire le help ? 

alx1->matju: détection de plusieurs personnes; détection avec deux caméras
(?);  détecter les formes; détecter les couleurs; support mpeg4; hotspots

<alx1> matju: another feature for the summer : select file to load via a
navigable menu as in 'file/open'
<matju> alx1: this is not a feature i can put in gridflow. if you want it,
then i can make one for pd or jmax or both, but it does not make sense to
add it to gridflow itself.
