Installation
[ ]

Documentation
[ ] review reference.html
[ ] review images of reference.html
[ ] change title bar
[ ] validate samples/inside
[ ] validate samples/outside
[ ] validate samples/020

General
[ ] remove memory leaks, segmentation faults
[ ] better error handling

Computation Objects
[ ] @! (unary ops)
[ ] @inner, @outer, @fold
[ ] @convolution
[ ] @redim, @dim (APL rho)
[ ] @resync (fast version of @export followed by @import)
[ ] @slice (@splice ?)
[ ] black option in @store
[ ] uint8 option in @store
[ ] @import~, @export~ (note:
	DSP->Control is feasible
	Control->DSP would be *very* kludgy)

Effects
[ ] blur, emboss, find edges, solarize, pinch, waves
[ ] see gimp for ideas
[ ] abyss effect, fractals
[ ] image-sur-image
[ ] n-frame delaying
[ ] Y*X*RGBA <-> Y*X packing (96 <-> 32 bits)

Structure & Protocol
[x] packets: output buffering
[ ] grid_end message (triads: begin,packet,end -> accept,process,finish)
[ ] check for too-short / too-long data vs. proposed dims.
[ ] change the protocol completely:
	not based on messages, but rather a push/pull combination,
	add GridStream objects, allow them to be passed in other
	messages; GridInlet,GridOutlet have redundant info, like the
	element counter, etc.
[ ] angles will be 0<=x<36000
[ ] unary ops: sq sqrt abs
[ ] binary ops: **
[ ] binary ops: <= != >=
[ ] binary ops: *sin -> b * sin(a * 2 * pi / 36000)
[ ] binary ops: atan2
[ ] trinary ops? eg. */ *+ ?: minmax &<< >>&
[ ] copy-on-write and similar tricks
[ ] support 0-dimensional values

Input/Output
[ ] in-place editing
[ ] implement byte-order, bit-order support in BitPacking
[ ] add PTC support
[ ] x11 shared memory working
[ ] x11 screen capture
[ ] multi-image (seq)
[ ] multi-file (multi)
[ ] Targa write support
[ ] JPEG support
[ ] QuickTime support

Misc
[ ] @print
[ ] @literal
[ ] how can I write unit tests?

Bugs
[ ] @video_out causes delayed crash when closing its associated window
[ ] @import bug with 0 dims
[ ] @export bug with init arguments

================
vin_file_test_2.jmax
0.2.0.pre3: 20 frames in 30 seconds.
0.2.0.pre8: 20 frames in  8 seconds (packet=16)
0.2.0.pre8: 20 frames in  4 seconds (packet=1k)

store3:
	28,36,128
	336,557,140
	179,15,183

what if I wanted to delay the various parts of the frame differently ? ie.
the pixels in the center are delayed 1 frame ......... and the pixels on
the ourside are delayed 25 frames ........; everything in the middle is
delayed discreetly between these 2 values.
